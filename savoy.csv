"First, the lobbyist (Ms. Lyn) was very friendly and offered us everything that could've made our stay enjoyable. It's remarkable how she knew us personally, and showed familiarity to us, even though we've just met 3 days ago. Kudos to her and the rest of the lobby staff.  We also booked a dine under the stars package and was assisted by our butler (Sir Joshua) with a very friendly and approachable manner. I'd like to commend his social skills and friendliness as it felt very genuine and in character. We loved his service and character so much and would definitely loved to see him grow within the company. I recommend him for any chance of promotion in his career path.",5,June 2023
"This hotel is one of our fav. so far. We came here for our honeymoon and we had a very long trip going here and from the moment we checked in, the hotel staff and the ambiance made us feel energized and relaxed. We were surprised to see our room which was prepared with some nice and lovely touches. They also give us a complimentary drink and a surprise honeymoon cake. Everything is excellent; 1.)their shuttle service (they have free shuttle service to take you to a station) and 2.)the accommodation (staff are very friendly and helpful. The room is spacious), 3.)the pool (their pool is so wide and they also have this bubble party, which my daughter really loves), 4.)the private beach (there is a shuttle that will take you to their private beach, we enjoy the kayak and the clean and crystal clear water) , and 5.)the breakfast buffet. We are definitely looking forward to returning here someday.‚Ä¶",5,August 2022
"Nice room accommodation and superb serviceü•∞ Please follow @philwonderstravel and we will assist your booking from airfare, Savoy accom and Airport transfer ‚ò∫Ô∏è Thank you Savoy for the great experience, will definitely go back! ",5,June 2023
"If you are looking for a place outside the hustle and bustle of the main beach, this one‚Äôs for you.   Pros: Their staff is very good and approachable. The room is clean with good sight of the pool, and slight overview of the beach. If you wanna go to DMall, you have a free shuttle service every 30min. Good breakfast buffet. Newcoast beach is a sight to see, with the clean water and free use of the paddle and kayak. There are also people there offering crystal kayak photo-op with your phone and I tell you, they will give the best shots with the great view.  Cons: The place is quite far from the main beach but izzokay. Slight improvement of the breakfast menu by including variety of fruits and desserts  Overall, me and my partner had a great experience with the hotel. Definitely, a 10/10!! Come and visit this place!!‚Ä¶",5,June 2023
"We loved everything about Savoy Hotel.  PROS:  This hotel was really affordable. Even during peak season, it was  really worth the price.  Hotel check in was a breeze. Staff were always welcoming and friendly. They had clean bathrooms, with very nice balcony view of the swimming pool. Their pools were awesome. Loved that they have 711 convenience store and Gongcha within the vicinity. They provided free shuttle to and from Dmall. The complimentary sunrise tour is a must. I just loved how their private beach was  well maintained and not overcrowded. Kudos to their staff for helping us with my sister‚Äôs broken luggage.  CONS: Since it‚Äôs on the newcoast, it‚Äôs really far from the white beach. If you‚Äôre not availing their free shuttle service, etrikes are 300 pesos per way. Buffet breakfast was tasty too, however, it could be improved. I wished they had corned beef or bacon. Hehe. My mom‚Äôs room‚Äôs keycard always malfunctioned.   Other than these, we really enjoyed our stay at Savoy Hotel Boracay! Until next time ü•∞‚Ä¶",4,May 2023

"Had a pleasant stay here in Savoy despite the fact that I had to wait 1 hour for the shuttle to arrive from Dmall to Savoy. But nonetheless, it was a great 1st time experience and we enjoyed the nice beach with free use of paddle and kayak. Thank you, Savoy!  Plus, I highly appreciate the birthday setup in our room. Superb experience",5,June 2023

"We just got married and we decided to have our honeymoon in Boracay and we stayed in Savoy for 8 days.   We booked 1 month ago. I called them and requested to have our room set up for newlyweds and they agreed. They said that the simple setup was free even though we are willing to pay.  Then 1 week before our flight to Boracay, I called them again for a reminder and they said that it was all noted.    When we arrived, there were no set up but we let it pass. However, the AC was not quite working on our room so we called the front desk. The maintenance went to our room and checked it. By 9pm, I was so tired because our flight was delayed prior. And the AC is still not getting cold so my husband called them again.   We requested to have our room changed and finally they agreed. By‚Ä¶",4,April 2023

"Savoy Boracay has been an awesome experience. The place it self is beautiful, the staff are very welcoming and friendly.   The only thing I don‚Äôt like is the open reception area, after a long day of staying in the heat I was looking forward to staying in a more colder area but was not able to do that until I got into the room.   I think it would be better for the reception area to be closed instead of a fully open area so that guests can be cool while they wait to be escorted into their bedroom.   My overall experience with beautiful and would definitely recommend and return back to savoy in Boracay. ",5,May 2023
"Top staff are top tier! Very friendly, helpful and very responsive. Norway, who was in the cafe and Keith in the lobby were exceptional! Food was great! Halo halo in the cafe was arguably the best I‚Äôve had in years. The facilities are awesome, tv, balcony, gym, pool, slippers and robes. The rooms could have been bigger though and an airport shuttle bus would be very helpful.",4,May 2023

"I am writing this review to provide feedback regarding the exceptional service given by the whole Savoy Hotel Boracay team during our stay last Laboracay 2023, particularly the Front Office Manager, Mr. Rein Pelayo and Hotel Staff/Driver, Mr. Jeffrey Ignacio.   The Front Office Manager, Mr. Rein Pelayo, was particularly exceptional. He went out of his way to make sure that our stay was comfortable and enjoyable, and was always available to answer any questions we had. He made us feel like a valued customer throughout our stay.  Every member of the team that we interacted with was friendly, professional, and eager to assist us in any way possible.

Whether I was lounging by the pool, indulging in a delicious meal at one of your restaurants, or taking advantage of the various activities and services offered, I always felt pampered and cared for.

"Second time coming here at Savoy and it was better this time around. The last time was during the pandemic with modified travel restrictions, so the place was a bit forlorn. But now the resort was lively with guests. Checking in was made seamless and hassle free by front desk officer Cheska (maraming salamat Cheska!). The room was still a bit compact but it afforded a great view all around. The housekeeping was helpful, the different areas (pool, grounds, lobby) are clean. 7-11 and gongcha shops are few steps away from the lower ground floor. Breakfast at the cafe still needs to improve on. The walk to the beach was made bearable with better footpath, and one can still use the shuttle going to and from the beach if one has the patience to wait.

Hotel staff are very accommodating and helpful. The what-to-do activities (free) are great and worth trying. There's a swimming pool foam party on weekends. We enjoyed our stay. Having the scheduled shuttle vehicle to and from going to hotel and Station 2 is very convenient.,5,April 2023
1. Location: a bit far out especially the road to get to this hotel is under construction so there was traffic on the way  2. Front Desk: I was surprised that a trainee at the front desk did the check in. Other hotels would not allow that. The other two front desk staff were just busy with their computers and did not even look at us even the three of them did not have guests in front. They should do the check in and just have the trainee as a back up if there‚Äôs long queue.  I feel bad for the trainee but he did well.  He also assisted with the room transfer. Probably needs more trainees if he will function as foa/bellman. He‚Äôll be exhausted at the end of the day.

"First of all, from entering the place, the lobby bathrooms are so dirty. No tissues, wet floor, and never did I see any personnel clean it.  The rooms are so small, and when we came in the room, it had no shampoo, soap, toothbrush, and even the coffee packs.   We requested for an extra mattress but it never came, and they all just told us that it couldn‚Äôt fit in the room.  The lobby personnel also often rolled their eyes at me whenever I would inquire about the scheduling of the transportation.  THE FOOD! WAD TERRIBLE! It was so expensive and it wasn‚Äôt even close to being good. They were either too salty or too bland. A meal for one is about 700 Php and you didn‚Äôt have a choice because it‚Äôs so far from the stations 1, 2, and 3.   Another thing I hated was the service shuttle.‚Ä¶",1,April 2023

"Being it the first time for me and my girlfriend travelling to Boracay i wanted to make it a special and memorable trip for us. I came across Savoy's Dine Under The Stars service as a surprise for my girlfriend and gave it a go, which i can say was worth every penny. You get what you paid for, wanted a nice romantic and peaceful dinner and that's what you get even more than what's expected.   Karren the Hotel's Events Specialist was so helpful and thorough throughout the process of reservation and provided every key details that is needed upto the last minute and provided everything that was requested.

Check in was amazing and fast.  Room was clean and amazing with beautiful view of the newcoast landscape.  However, shower gel was not refilled but it's ok I have my own toiletries.

I would like to commend the butler, sometimes they offer to take a pictures of me in sunrise and rock formation tour. 2. Food - breakfast buffet is so worth it, new and well cooked. I suggest if you could lower the price especially for solo travelers because I am solo but paying for 2pax in breakfast buffet. 3. Place - very clean, comfy, all sheets are new according to smell, the pool is superb not over populated. Far from stations 1-3 but the area is peaceful highly recommended if you want to rest, have a private beach, near the sunrise view. 4. Accessibility - it is far from the main‚Ä¶",5,March 2023
"Checked into The Savoy as an alternative to the busy Station 2 down at white beach for some peace and quiet. However this turned out to be anything but with loud, booming music, morning , noon and night. It was so loud that we had to move rooms as ours overlooked the pool area. The food was average at best, and whilst appreciating this to be a filipino hotel, breakfast offered no filipino alternatives, so was very limiting if you do not like filipino food. Service was poor with no clearing of plates, serving coffee etc. Whilst there is a lovely beach 5 minutes walk there is a shuttle service into White Beach, however this is very busy and over subscribed. Whilst the room and balcony were pleasent enough our overall stay was spoilt by the issues referred to. Not recommended.",2,March 2023

"There were a lot of confirmed arrangements that weren't delivered last minute leaving organizers pressed for time to adjust, adding unnecessary expenses. People were nice and was showing willingness to do it but their capacity is just isn't there yet.  Food selection isn't great, was repetitive and bordering bland. We weren't advised that room refresh only happens every 3 days! So when some of our associates asked for a room refresh, they're told, it's not time for refresh yet. One of the associates brought their family, one of their kids had a bad tummy and vomited on the bed, instead of being asked for medical care, the first comment was, they will ask their management if the family had to pay for laundry for the sheets.

From being surprised with some balloons and cake upon check in, to simple sweet touches after every room make up, they definitely did their best to make our stay even more special. We enjoyed the privacy in the hotel. Despite having lots of guests, we did not feel like the hotel is crowded. We enjoyed swimming in the pool, walking along their own secluded beach, and having our dinners in the cafe. The complimentary shuttle going to and from D Mall also ensures that we get to experience the other side of Boracay.

"It was my first time at the Newcoast, and I was blown away by Savoy! The hotel is very chic yet chill, and was immaculately clean. My Deluxe room was perfect for my needs, as I intended to be out and about the island. It had a lounge and a balcony, and I spent some time on both to write. There was a short walk to the beach, which I like, because it brought me to a beautiful endpoint, which was the Keyhole. I had me time on the shore with nearly zero other people, and it was a welcome respite from the noise of the Main Beach. I thought it was genius that the hotel has a 7-11--literally everything I needed was there! At the price point that I got my room with breakfast (great spread and excellent bread!),  Savoy fit me to a tee. I tried a buffet dinner and it was yummy, not to‚Ä¶",5,January 2023

"The place is good, nice ambiance and scenery.. the pool was clean and we had fun in it. The place is quite far from the main station (dmall etc) but they've got shuttle and you need to book in advance or else you‚Äôll gonna look for your own ride which is quite expensive. They are telling you to go downhill/main road to look for your own ride. They‚Äôve got water dispenser in the hallway which is good. One drawback is toilet, not the worst but it was very uncomfortable. The floor was already levelled that when you take a shower the water stays all over the place. Very risky because the floor is too slippery and you can literally need to put a lot of towel in the floor. The room doesnt have enough space for your clothes, you need to attach the plug  for the kettle in some place‚Ä¶",3,January 2023

"Go to Savoy Hotel.    Heavenly peace in the Boracay Newcoast.   This I say - coming from the USA, where mostly everywhere,  all you see and hear nowadays, notably from the mainstream news media, is the corrosive diabolical force of the constant focus on the negativity,      .   We had a great vacation.   In the Philippines,  everywhere we went, we were treated with  genuine respect and hospitality.  It was evident, those virtues are spiritually and divinely ingrained in the heart and mind of the God fearing Filipino.

Just a tip to be prepared with your schedule if you are planning to go to stations 1 and 2 and book ahead for shuttle reservation at the front desk for the complimentary shuttle to Dmall so that you will save some money and avoid from shedding out fare for transpo which cost 300 pesos per ebike trip from savoy to D‚Äômall.

"Savoy Hotel Boracay New Coast is 30 minutes away from the iconic Boracay White beach which is filled with tourists. It has its own Cove type beach which is a 10 minutes walk from the hotel. But getting back to the hotel from the beach takes a lot of effort since you either walk on an inclined plane or use the stairs. You can also ask the security guard at the beach to call for a transpo, though it takes time since they don't have a dedicated shuttle to the beach. There are parts of the beach that kinda rocky but there are also parts that have soft powdery sand. I suggest to bring your beach shoes for comfort and safety. There are free kayak and paddle boards at the beach area which you can use for 15 mins. You just need to sign a form.  There are also crystal kayak if you want‚Ä¶",4,December 2022

I was visiting Boracay and wanted to find somewhere special to take my partner to propose to. We didn't stay at the hotel but we dined here.   A few google searches later this romantic dinner by the beach caught my eye and before you know it it was booked and paid for.   From the get go the service was great. Karren the organiser was amazing keeping me informed at all times whilst answering any of my questions replying within minutes usually.   We arrived at the savoy hotel at 5pm and was greeted by Lovely staff to be seated in the lobby area. We waited for around 5-10 minutes for a escort vehicle to pick us up from the lobby and drive us to the beach.   My partner didn't have a clue about any of this so it was a lovely surprise for her.

We understand the situation the travel industry is going through because of the pandemic, but the change is very noticeable. The services downgraded, and the staffing isn‚Äôt enough to handle guests specially the front desk. Staffs are overwhelmed and overworked since there are very few staffs. Another thing is the shuttle service, guests are not accommodated properly and usually some guests are left behind because they do not fit in one van.

Free Van Service is not convenient. Indicated with our booking that it has complete amenities but they don't give the amenity kits unless you ask for it.

"With apprehension, i booked Savoy Newcoast Boracay for our 25th Anniversary with my 2 children. As it turned out, this was the perfect choice!  Away from the noise and bustle of white beach, we were on our own, ""private and world class"" enclave. The rooms and amenities given their rate per night were seemingly more than what you pay for.  The hotel, which just re-opened last June, is well maintained. The pool bar is superb. And the beach, while it was a short walk, is simply amazing. And we enjoyed the free use of the paddleboard and kayak! The sunrise tour at the keyhole was simply majestic.  But above all, the SERVICE of SAVOY is truly what makes it an outstanding haven to stay in...Kudos to all the staff.

Unfortunately, we weren't able to try their other restaurants as it wasn't operating for the time being except for the Savoy Cafe. Regardless, the food and breakfast buffet were all amazing and extremely pleasant to our picky palate. We also had our transport back to the airport arranged by the staff. Definitely saved us a lot of time trying to book with another transport service and much cheaper when done with the hotel. Definitely coming back the next time we visit Boracay again.

In general the location didn't bother us like others, you just have to plan and book the shuttle 2 or 3 hrs before you want to go to d'mall.   Staff especially by the pool and concierge were excellent. Food however, at the pool was generally slow to arrive and never set the world alight, all rather uninspiring - and as a result we didn't eat at the hotel much.   Housekeeping really wasn't good.¬† At best, patchy, at worse not acceptable. We had to constantly ask for more water toilet roll and replenishment for the shower gel etc, it was almost as if all we had was a bed making service and they ignored we had an infant.

"Stayed here with a group of friends for several days. The Boracay experience felt new and refreshing given that the resort is located in the island's other side, although a bit quite far from the center. The location has pros and cons. It works for travelers who want to stay away from the noise and buzz of White Beach area. It can be inconvenience for those who wish to be near White Beach. So it's up to the traveler/s and the itinerary.  Recommended for groups/ families with kids. Here are what I personally liked: - Warm customer service by the staff, very responsive - Lots of spaces to run/ jog in - Loved the cold towel and welcome drinks upon arrival  - Private beach!  - Sunrise tour",5,June 2022

What is best about the newly re-opened Savoy Boracay is its management and hotel staff!   Hotel Manager REIN PELAYO made sure that our stay is comfortable from the time we arrived until our shuttle ride to the airport three days later - even upgrading us to a bigger room with a view of the pool. He would periodically check on us during our entire stay. :)   The staff - from the shuttle drivers to the front desk to the Savoy cafe and the pool attendants were uniformly hospitable and pleasant. General Manager ELMAR was also very gracious and made personal contact with us.   Breakfast has many dishes and food tastes great!  Although ala carte items are on the pricey side and guests don't have much choice since it is the only food outlet in the hotel other than a 24-hour 7-11 store‚Ä¶,4,June 2022

"Savoy greatly satisfied our cravings! I mean cravings for the following: 1.	Foods-Their buffet breakfast offers variety of savory and palatable dishes, perfect for a great start every day. I especially love the beef tapa. 2.	Service- I think this is their best asset, among all other their commendable offers. I always believe that the way the company treats their employees/staff reflects in the way their crew/staff/employees act or behave. They serve with their hearts; they are committed with their work too. Let me enumerate the instances showing these: (1) The staff know what you needed before you even utter what you need(example:offering drinking water and towels for the pool); (2) They are courteous too; (3) The room attendants are honest.

"We stayed several nights here in Savoy last week for my teenage son's birthday. Happy that we chose this hotel vs those in White Beach. While it is a 15-minute ride from Stations 1 to 3 (note: Savoy has a scheduled shuttle going to D Mall), Savoy offers a welcome respite from the hustle and bustle of Manila and of White Beach. It has its own private beach that it shares with Belmont Hotel, and a glorious pool which the kids (and the adults) loved. Special mention to Herbson who tended to our needs at the pool bar and also went the extra mile. Herbson and his asst, Rezza, made our son's birthday a bit more special. Thanks again, Savoy Boracay.

Checked in during soft opening & started off on the wrong foot with the rooms we stayed jn but favorably Rein the hotel manager was able to address our concerns which enabled us to enjoy our stay.  Buffet breakfast is good including food servings for lunch and dinner but there is much to be improved on in terms of taste and flavor (for some menu). Overall serving is value for money and does not require us to find meal outside of the hotel.  Seriously considering returning to Savoy,4,June 2022

I emailed the corporate email but was redirected to Directwithhotels for my query.

So I needed to wait for feedback from Directwithhotels before Savoy Hotel could do anything.   I emailed Directwithhotels and was informed that my reservation was non-refundable and cancellable since it was their promo rate.

"Savoy made our stay in Boracay very worth while, awesome, and peaceful.  When we arrived (Sunday) it was kinda eerie though, almost no lights and people around. As if like alone and peaceful was too much, but later on people started coming back from the white beach and have a night swim.  Location wise, the hotel is far from the White beach but they provide shuttles going to and from there. It's not beachfront, they have a private beach (awesome one) you can reach within 10mins walk, or via shuttle they provide. *Maybe this is my inner introvert self, but it's kinda great that the location of the place is not in the main White beach, it kinda adds to relaxing feeling that it's away from the tourist crowd.

"Don't be fooled by the nice pictures just as we were. The hotel is not beach front but is located in the middle of nowhere. It is a hassle having to wait for the shuttle service or take a tricycle just to get a bite to eat. Savoy is fairly new but it is far from a 4 star resort as advertized. It feels more like a mid to low end condo which suits bargain travelers.   I have stayed in countless hotels worldwide and not once has housekeeping ever woken me up at 9am just to clean our room - and this is after staying up very late while (hanging out at Station 1) so we wanted to sleep in.

"First time to Boracay, stayed for three nights at this very nice resort. Like other reviews noted, Savoy is not near White Beach, but we knew that going in that it would be a different Boracay experience. We didn‚Äôt expect the typhoon which hit the island hard on Christmas Day. Very sad to see the damage on the way to and from the jetty port to the resort.  Here are our thoughts: - We took the shuttle arranged by the hotel (southwest tours) and service was great and on time. Not sure why they receive negative reviews. Keep in mind that if you choose to have the porters take your luggage on the jetty, it‚Äôs 200 pesos per bag - Which leads to next point. It‚Äôs better to travel light to Boracay. We couldn‚Äôt because we are from North America on an 18 day trip so we had lots of heavy‚Ä¶",5,January 2020

"Ang ganda ng hotel at super nice and accommodating ng mga staff nila, front desk, van transfer, pool assistants and food servers, especially si Arnie. Our hotel room is just right for our family and they do daily housekeeping, no need to request for it. We stayed here for 4 days and we loved it. The food is sumptuous and they serve buffet breakfast with different menus daily. They have a pickup and drop off schedule for their guests para its easier for us to go to the main beach anytime. They also have activities for the kids so they never get bored. We're definitely coming back for another vacation here. Thank you Savoy Hotel for a wonderful experience.",5,February 2020

"Upon arrival I was greeted right away. The check-in was smoothly done. Ericson (the front desk) was very helpful and went over the activities they have going on and the location of the beach. I also love the breakfast they served. Loved the location of the property away from bustling town and away from the tourist. I will definitely come back with friends and family.

"The hotel is in a newly developed area in the north of the island, also prone to wind. We were there mid january and it was very windy so we were unable to use our balcony or the private beach. The hotel seem to cater to families primarily, the pools were busy with kids and the breakfast buffets in both restaurants were noisy. It would have been nice if there were some separation for adults to be able to relax and enjoy the facilities without the hoopla. The hotel is fine in general, and staff is helpful, but since it's far from any entertainment or shopping on site, could benefit from adding more of that, for all age groups. Last, there was a complicated procedure to use credit cards in their restaurants with some pre-deposit rule, perhaps it was temporary due to the recent‚Ä¶",3,January 2020

Good points  - transport is frequent and no prob getting shuttle to the main town (d mall)  - hotel is clean and private beach beautiful  - food in the restaurant, breakfast is nice  - Swimming pool average  - room clean and organised   Bad points - There are a lot of China people staying here (I am not against them but the recent corona-virus, makes me very uneasy and have to wear üò∑ around)  - The staff and customer service are terribly slow.

"My husband and I went here last week and so far the over-all experience was great.   Pro's: - It was on the other side of the white beach so it would be perfect if you want to avoid too much crowd as it also has it's own beach which is the ""Cove Beach"". - It has a shuttle which can transfer you to the Cove beach/vise versa.  - They also have series of shuttles which can drop you off/pick you up should you want to go to the main beach. They will drop you off at Jollibee d' mall.  - They have 2 big pools for adults and 2 kiddie pools which are open till 10pm - Though there are still some areas that were undergoing construction, it really looks promising since they plan to have retail stores and restos within the vicinity. - The staff is always responsive, accomodating and friendly‚Ä¶",4,January 2020
"The place is clean and the wait staff is earnest but the hotel is hugely overpriced for what you get. The hallways reminded me of the Hallway from the movie The Shining, with an Asian twist. The food was nasty, my Cesar Salad had raw bacon and overcooked chicken in it. We got off the ferry and the ‚ÄúDoor to door‚Äù service we paid for was a joke. We waited 30 minutes for the van to take us to the hotel, instead they dropped us off at Jolibee‚Äôs and we were told it would be 40 minutes until the shuttle came to pick us up. (Another hotel staff made us aware of this fact, no one from the Savoy to be found).

I was traveling with a close friend and her daughter (my inaanak) who just turned 4 this January. I saw in one of the reviews how Savoy arranged a birthday surprise and I figured I should make the same arrangements for me and the little lady. The person I talked to noted my request.   There were a few mishaps with our flight from Clark to Caticlan. Our flight got super delayed.

"Very disappointed with everything about this Hotel. Both the restaurant and the snack bar have the same menu and these are the only places to eat within miles. Nothing within walking distance. You have to take a shuttle bus to the beach, which is not even a nice one compared to others on the island. If you want a sea view it also comes with a construction view! However the worst thing about this hotel is the rooms. Very dated and very basic and small. If you are large you will struggle to fit in the bathroom as you have to shut the door before you can open the shower screen!! It felt like a proper rip off because they mentioned several times had we booked directly on the website they could have changed our room and picked us up at the airport. We booked through a travel agency‚Ä¶",1,December 2019

"Savoy is definitely one for the books; world-class interiors, very well-trained and accommodating staffs, super clean pools and easiest access to Boracay New Coast which feels like their private beach!  Would like to commend all staffs that helped us during our stay - from the front desk, kitchen and housekeeping. Shoutout to Shiela of housekeeping! She was really nice and accommodating all throughout our stay. She even surrender our money left at the hotel. Such a nice staff!   Will definitely miss Savoy. It feels like home.

"We stayed in Savoy for 3 nights during our trip. We were very impressed with the amenities - 2 large pools that aren‚Äôt overly crowded at anytime was a highlight. The inclusive breakfast was also delicious, although it could use more variety and include more breakfast staples such as bacon, sausages and waffles. Be aware also that there aren‚Äôt any other places to eat nearby other than the hotel cafe which is a bit pricey.  The location is Boracay Newcoast, a relatively new development in Boracay about 20 mins from White Beach. The shuttles to get to the beach are first come first serve though they add extra vehicles if there are a lot of people going. However, the shuttles going back to the hotel from D‚ÄôMall are extremely full especially in the evening, so tricycles are a better‚Ä¶",5,January 2020

Hotel beach is accessible by hotel shuttle which comes and goes as you please but you can easily get there on foot. Food in a restaurant was great as well. Hotel also provides shuttle to the dmall but they arrange also other routes e.g. to puka shell beach which I highly recommend for waves lovers.

"I stayed at the Savoy Hotel one night instead of 8. Since the living conditions were unacceptable, I ended my stay on 28 Dec 2019. The room had an unpleasant smell, the ceiling in the bathroom fell off, there were a lot of dirty spots on all the furniture and walls, the ventilation grille was covered with moss and the ventilation itself did not work. Please look at the photos attached.  The manager confirmed that the property will charge for 1 night only. Unfortunately, I did not receive any information about the refund, although 2 weeks have already passed. I contacted Agoda and they inform me that they haven't received any contacts from the property in regards to my reservation hence why they haven't amended the reservation.   Absolutely unacceptable for a 4-star hotel.",1,December 2019

"THIS IS NOT A BEACHFRONT HOTEL. The hotel is far from the beaches-30 minutes to get to Station 2. Although there is a shuttle the wait is 1.5 hours in between. And it‚Äôs a first come first serve ride. Although there are transportations you can take to go to the beaches, each way cost $6. Also since this hotel gives out discount it is popular to tourists and therefore crowded. For a more thorough review of the hotel, read Pan‚Äôs review below. I agree with most of what was said.  If you do want to be isolated and be far from the madding crowd, this hotel would be good. Clean and good service. The restaurant menu though is limited. There is a pool and a private beach nearby. But why go to Boracay and be isolated. There are other choices and near the beaches.",2,January 2020
"The hotel is quite new, actually a great place if you wanted to have a chill vibe. Its quite far from the used to be crowded stations in Boracay. Initial plan is just literally my me time and I did not plan anything at all for the trip, I actually pictured myself, staying the whole time in the hotel coz i read from the website that it has its own beach coast/shoreline and it got me excited. But pass forward to almost 2 weeks before the trip, I realize room is too big for 1 so I decided to ask my parents to go with me. My sisters took care of their tickets while I took care of everything during our stay in Boracay.

Imagine the chaos from Caticlan Pier since tourists that were stranded from dec 24-25 wanted to get a ferry ride to Boracay. When we arriived at Savoy, thankfully the queue for check-in was not long yet but the waiting time just to get our room took awhile. It was quite understandable since there was no electricity and phone signal and only generators were running. But Despite of all this, the staff remained calm, helpful, patient and smiling at all times.

Activities were limited as clean up activities at the resort (pool house suffered damages, trash was covering beach front,..) & in Boracay were ongoing.  But the resort was well backed up (generators, food availability,...)

You can feel they love their job, which gives the hotel a very cozy atmosphere. The hotel's facilities and the rooms are modern and very clean. It was delightful to swim in the clean cool pool water.  Although the hotel is off the beaten track, there is shuttle service bringing and picking you up near to stations 1-3, Boracay's touristic heart, every 1.5 hours.

Only downside of the hotel is the terrible wifi connection.

"Lengthy review - after 9 nights we left with mixed feelings.   Private beach:  Is actually semi-private - so I consider this false advertisement -, private area is where the sun beds are and if you try to move them further down from the green flag posts, staff will come and tell you it is no allowed due to government regulation. Anyone can come and enjoy the beach, there are no entry restrictions.  There are toilets at the beach, however, they are not really usable nor clean, some are used for storage and there was no toilet paper. Towels are usually available at the beach but not always consistent. Similarly, they sometimes have soft drinks and beers on offer but you would need cash with you.  The beach is a 7 minutes walk downhill from the hotel which is okay, but for those‚Ä¶",2,December 2019

I left my charger after check-out and they were able to give it back to me. Special thanks to Ms. Katrina for all the help during my stay. The location is far from Stations 1-3 but it‚Äôs fine if you are looking for a quiet getaway. They also have free shuttle from hotel to Jollibee D‚Äômall and vice versa. I think the travel time from the hotel to D‚Äômall is 20mins. There is also a band singing at night near the Chamberry Pool Bar. Their rooms were pretty clean and they also have a private beach!

"This place definitely deserves a shout out! I loved my stay. The hotel is situated away from hustle and bustle of the main strip boracay and a free shuttle could easily take you in the white beach in no time.   But if you are not a party person like myself and just want to have a non-stressful holiday, it has its own private beach as well.   The buffet breakfast is to die for.  It has a lot of selections... and i mean A LOT!!! So if you want a brunch before you head out, it will definitely give you a fill.

We were ecstatic that we had adjacent rooms booked to all of us so we can easily go to each other's rooms.   Breakfast buffet was superb with Filipino, Asian, Continental selections.

Our room was spacious & clean. We stayed at their Executive room; it has 2 bathrooms, 2 verandas, a cozy queen-sized bed plus a big sofa. We had a great view of the beach & almost the entire resort. Their daily buffet is great; they served us with fantastic array of foods. All their staffs are so friendly and always wear their smiles for us! One incident that really made me happy was this story: one sunny morning when I asked Yosh, one of Savoy caf√©'s staffs, if the buffet will serve us their tapa as one of my cousins told me that this was so good.

Transport excellent, check in excellent, very hospitable staff offering advice and information. Throughout our stay we felt we were very well looked after, nothing was too much, customer care was second to none. Too many to mention but Mayflor, Christian, Mark, Gretel, were exceptional and we would like to thank them once again for making our 1st Wedding Anniversary so special.

They were particularly wonderful with the children and seemed to genuinely enjoy watching them have fun and went out of their way to get things for them to enjoy in the pool and keep them entertained. Really impressive.  The hotel itself is a good standard. Fairly new, great pool, and good facilities. Good value for money. The restaurants (really one restaurant with different places to sit) serves lots of different types of food and generally the standard was good. Pasta in particular was well done.

"My friend and I had an amazing stay at Savoy Boracay. The staff were very attentive and accommodating. Thank you to Ms. Rose and Mr. Jumong for all the assistance when we were checking in.   Do not be discouraged if Savoy is not located in the center of Boracay (Stations 1 to 3) or along the beach front. I see this as their strong point since you will be away from the crowd especially for families who wants to enjoy their stay/vacation in peace. You can still enjoy and experience Boracay since Savoy has all the facilities and activities for their guests.   Of course, if you still want to go to the front beach to catch the sunset, Savoy has a complimentary shuttle service from and to the hotel. You may also catch the sunrise at their private beach, a 10-minute walk from the hotel.",5,November 2019

Congratulations to chef Allen and his staff.  Wow. The breakfast buffet was very diverse and had something for everyone. I could go on and on.

"I initially booked Savoy Boracay since they had a promo. It says in the website that it was only 15mins going to d'mall and they have a shuttle every hour and in the map it was just right beside Fairways.  When we got to the hotel, it was pretty new, modern and nice, but i noticed that it took us 30 mins to get there from d'mall since there were road constructions ans i wasn't advised about that. Also their private beach is not right by the hotel, you would have to take a shuttle or walk for about 10 mins. The hotel is technically right beside fairways but the entrance of Savoy was like 5-10mins away from Fairways..

Relatively organized (just need to make sure you find the hotel rep and give them your room number so you're queued).  Cons: -Let's not kid ourselves, this is faaaar from the main beach. Shuttle would take about 30 mins from the hotel to D'Mall. And the roads are still mostly under construction, which results in a bumpy, uncomfortable ride. -Breakfast.

"This is a bit of a funny one. The property is a new one in a newly developed part of Boracay - the Boracay Newcoast.  It has tons of things going for it - nice rooms, good staff, modern amenities.  However, there are a few challenges. The location is very far from White Beach and not that easy to get to as not all tuk tuks are fine going to Newcoast plus some cannot handle the elevation of the road to the property. Also, when it rains, getting from Newcoast to the rest of island can be quite challenging.   Furthermore, our initial room had a terrible smell which was bad enough that we had to ask for a change of room. The staff was helpful and allowed us a change but surely this should be taken care of before a room is allocated.  All in all, I would recommend this place for‚Ä¶",3,November 2018

"Situated in Newcoast, far from the overcrowded white beach area. Approximately 30 minutes away by hotel shuttle to station 1,this posh hotel will truly provide you with a relaxing stay. The staff are courteous and always ready to assist you in any way they can. Amenities include pools of different sizes and depths, restaurants (including a pool side bar), a spa, a gym, and the best for me is the private beach at the Newcoast Cove 2. They provide shuttles to guests who want to go to the beach. They even provide beach towels. The private beach may not be as powdery soft as that of the white beach, but the sea is calmer and less intimidating. And of course, only the in house guests are allowed to use it so it is not as crowded as the white beach. They offer several beach activities‚Ä¶",5,September 2019

It's good that they have complimentary schedules shuttles to the city center. We missed a schedule but we were accommodated by to use their employee shuttle to the nearest mall which we really appreciated. Beware of tricycles who charges more than the regular rates.

"The area is exclusively located in station 1, far away from the crowded and busy site of station 2, the place is not for budget travelers, although there is a shuttle that goes to and fro D Mall, there is no other pick up point anywhere else, so if you are to go to restaurants in between, you need to hire a tricycle going back the hotel, it cost P300 to the hotel entrance, because regular tricycles passes only by the gate entrance of Boracay Newcoast it would be a very long walk to get to the hotel. If you are looking for a quiet and secluded place to relax, this is the perfect getaway. They have their own beach that caters the best view of sunrise.

"A peaceful, family-friendly retreat from the bustle of the other side of the island. A beautiful beach sheltered from the westerly winds with free use of kayaks. Free activities arranged for every day. A lot of rooms on higher floors (ie 3rd or above) have sea views because of the arc design of the hotel. We got a corner room with really big balcony where you could watch the sun rise in the morning and sit with a drink in the evening. Pool bar in evening very pleasant. Only there 3 nights but would have been happy to stay a week. Lots of shuttle buses down to the main town areas which could lead to a bit of an undignified scramble for seats on the return journey, but the main problem with the travel back and forth was the bad state of roads, which is not the fault of the hotel.",5,August 2019

Pools are also great, they have kid's pool and outdoor spa - this is my favorite spot because the water is warm. Kudos to all the staff! I just wanted to commend Uriah, Sarah they are very accommodating as well as the manager on duty, their staffs for breakfast, their guides in the pool and those assigned in souvenir shop, all are friendly and polite. (too bad can't remember all their names) kudos also to the two housekeeping ladies assigned to fourth floor. We'll definitely come back and recommend this hotel to our‚Ä¶",5,August 2019
"We went to Savoy's beach due to the bad weather we can't swim at Crimson's beach (Crimson's customer service is the worst btw). Their mini bar was closed but their kind staff assisted us to buy our drinks. The beach was clean and we had so much fun, this moment was the only memory we can treasure from Boracay. We should've stayed here instead of Crimson, will definitely bring my family to Savoy this November.",5,August 2019
"Savoy Hotel Boracay is a best kept secret in this island paradise in Boracay. Tucked at the other side of the island, the hotel is away from the tourists making it a pure haven away from the noise and the crowd. The sand is not as powdery as in the main stations of Boracay, but the water is cleaner and more perfect for a relaxing dip (unlike in the main stations where at any given day one is most likely to bump into a person or a paddle board!). The room is very cozy. I was given a low floor so I didn‚Äôt have a view of the ocean. But I had a view of the swimming pool which was great as well. The room might be a bit small than the usual but the amenities are first class. Mattress and pillows are heavenly, curtains are thick enough to block the sun for a sleep in.

"Breakfast:  Not the best breakfast in Boracay. Food quality and selection is underwhelming. We had better ones during past visits in Coast Hotel or Henann's Sea Breeze Cafe or the Sunny side cafe down station 3.  Private Beach:  - No available towels. you have to go back to the hotel's poolside to borrow one. - Seats are limited during our stay. - No drinks/snacks available at Private Beach  Location: Going to D mall is a big hassle since you are limited to the shuttle schedule if you miss it, then you lose about 1.5 hours till the next one arrives. Travel time to D Mall takes around 30-40 mins. We will consider going back when Retail Establishments are finally open.

"It was all worth the penny!   Good thing that we have decided to stay in Savoy Hotel Boracay for the birthday get-away of my daughter. I would like to thank their Front Office Manager, John, for the surprise birthday set-up request in the room upon arrival. It certainly delighted my daughter! (and it matters a lot for that trip) He made sure that our stay will be comfortable and proactively gave suggestions on do's and dont's especially that we have a baby with us.   Staff were all friendly, from their Concierge to the staff in the resto, housekeeping and the guys in the pool area. Joms in the Concierge offered for their shuttle to take us to their private beach while we still have an hour to wait for the shuttle to the main beach (D'Mall) and he made sure that we were picked up‚Ä¶",5,July 2019
"The restaurant staff were very attentive and went above and beyond to meet my dietary needs.   However I did have an issues with the drainage of the water in the shower and after two times after complaining.   The only downfall about the hotel rooms is that the curtains are very light in colour and the sun is really bright from very early in the morning ( Not ideal when you are trying to have a lie in)  There is a lovely private beach and kayaking is free of charge. They also have a free shuttle bus down to the main beach of Boracay.   Overall, it was a relaxed stay.",4,July 2019
"If you are wondering how beautiful the island is without being disappointed with the crowd then, this is the place to stay. It is far from the main cove, up on a hill in a secluded community with a private beach with the same powdery white sand.   The room has a good enough space. Housekeeping keeps the room clean though, they do not bring down any utensils you will borrow from the kitchen/ cafe. That is a bit weird, though.Oh well, that's because we brought them up and not asked for housekeeping to bring it. But the little extra service to actually wash our wine glasses would have been nice, right?   It  would also be great to have a Bible, pen and stationary. These are staple hotel stuff that I miss in this one.   The toilet and batch is clean though it has some funky smell.‚Ä¶",4,July 2019

"10/10 review for Savoy Hotel Boracay  We enjoyed staying in Savoy! They have nice facilities, rooms, staffs, foods, a private beach and other services.   We also want to commend the FO staff: Ms. Carmela and Ms. Ella for setting up a surprise welcome greeting for us.   For the effort and a great job of the F&B team in helping my fianc√© to surprise me of a dinner date by the beach: Mr. Romeo, Lhorenz, Chester, Gail, Mhel and another two staffs (sorry I forgot the names but I sent a commendation letter for them last July 24, 2019)  Mr. Joms for always welcoming us with a friendly smile, and for all the staff that was very courteous.

"Went to Boracay without knowing what Savoy Hotel is all about since they are fairly new but this hotel swept me of my feet once I stepped inside. Great modern design, friendly staff, nice facilities, sumptous food, room with a view of the coast, etc. What more can you ask for? Loved the place since you have the choice of going to the stations to party with the crowd or stay at the hotel and take in the serenity of the hotel. Good job, Savoy! We will surely be back.",5,July 2019
This hotel and it‚Äôs staff is truly a luxury experience! Your every need is catered to and they go the extra mile to ensure you feel so welcome.

The free shuttle service is excellent! Thank you!,5,July 2019

"My family and I have just had a four night stay at The Savoy Hotel and from the moment Jess greeted us on arrival our stay was nothing short of a perfect family holiday largely due to the friendliness and professionalism shown by the entire staff of the property.. Mayflor who is one of the F&B supervisors was really friendly always taking the time to stop and talk with us, her style of leadership filtered down each time we dined. Edmar, Raven or any one of the fantastic staff made my family feel welcome and couldn‚Äôt do enough for us during every visit to the restaurant. Our housekeeper Carmoline went out of her way to make our stay comfortable, she made our baby a turtle and an elephant out of towels something that probably took a minute to do but stays in a guest head a lot‚Ä¶",5,July 2019
"Great staff, service and amenities. Would definitely come back to this hotel.   A short ride to the public beach in Station 2 where you can enjoy a magnificient sunset, food and some shopping. Take note of the pick up times for the shuttle.  Has a private beach. Good for family with young kids and for those who just want to relax (i.e. read under a shade). Visit early to catch the sunrise.  Daily mass is available at the Holy Rosary Church. 6:30 AM (Tagalog), 5:00 PM (English). Station 2. Ask for help from reception to arrange for a local ride (electric tricycle - yes the Town is environmentally friendly - e-Bus and e-Tricycle -sits 10 pax).

Impeccable staff; very courteous attentive, they know what you need even before you need it.  Room and amenities (pools, common areas, beach) are clean and well kept. Very modern facility but not a harsh contrast to the serenity of place. Food is amazing, the breakfast buffet is definitely A++ given the wide array of selection.",5,July 2019

(depends on your preference)  I am a family man so I prefer to be away from the hustle and bustle of Boracay as much as possible. The staff were very courteous, proactive and helpful. everyone we interacted with catered our needs  and no one left us hanging..

"""We‚Äôre on our family/business trip vlogging everything about Boracay. We ended up booking Savoy. It has a beach sharing which you‚Äôll need a request of shuttle. Another thing is that they are FAR away from stations. But we don‚Äôt mind since they have swimming pools and not beach nearby. Take note of the ff:  1. Rooms. Okay if you don‚Äôt mind a shower curtain instead of separate one. Still you can sleep decently. BUT BEWARE OF EARLY MORNING CHINESE GUESTS SHOUTING.  2.

They deliver as advertised.  Crew and staff are delightful to have around and extremely courteous and helpful without being overbearing.  The beach trumps the main white beach if you want tranquility and privacy.  Make sure you ask for the tide schedule to truly enjoy it.  White sand and blue skies.  Shuttle rides are available almost on demand  and its a short 1 minute ride.  You can walk towards it but going back might pose a challenge as the incline is steep.  The nearby Belmont hotel is about to open and the area will become crowded.  Hopefully both management can manage this efficiently.  The rooms are chic and some overlook the pool.

Nice Place but too far from the white beach Long waiting lines at the shuttle services provided by the hotel and not on time. The room was kinda small but it was presentable and clean. We experienced some difficulty using their room key card due to some battery issues at their door. The breakfast served was good! The staff are friendly and accommodating but during check-out time the guests flocked at the lobby but we really enjoyed the heated pool which is perfect for the cool temperature of the area especially at night.

"Staying in front of the beach in any of the stations (1 to 3) seems convenient for easy access to the beach but the problem is that the number of tourists and sounds makes it good for some time but not for the whole day. We liked that the Savoy is in a peaceful side of the island so to rest was not an issue. The hotel offers a free shuttle to Station 2 so the access to the touristic area was not an issue and those days when we didn't want to be surrounded by pushy vendors (like you often find in the Stations 1 to 3) we used the hotel's private beach, used the kayak a couple of times and enjoyed the time reading and resting with a drink from the bar located in the same beach.

Fair warning, the place is located far from the usual hustle and bustle of the beach but if you like a certain exclusivity, peace and quiet like me after a day in the beach then this place is perfect.

I had the chance to visit Boracay during my vacation last January. I always go in Boracay since Im also from Aklan Province and its just near to my Hometown. We celebrate special occasion in the island as well as New years eve. Before my vacation I registered to be a member of Club Access that entitles me to a lot of discounts to different affiliated Hotels. One of them is Savoy Boracay. I availed my free night stay in this Hotel and I really enjoyed it. It was a great place. I was told that there is a free shuttle from D‚ÄôMall to their property. You know in Boracay the Local transporters charges you a lot most especially if the Hotel Location is too far from the port. So I decided to take a motorcycle ride to the Hotel but unfortunately that driver is driving without license and‚Ä¶,5,January 2019
"Me and my partner celebrated our anniversary in the island and we stayed here in Savoy. Staffs we're really helpful in terms of our requests and the property have their own beach for the guests within the premises. Ella and Carmela, helped me to make our stay memorable. Guests should try their own restaurant and order the Filipino palabok which is really delicious. And they even have different activities per day.  We would love to stay here again when we visit the island and hopefully they offer more activities to the guests.",5,May 2019

I loved the beef bulgogi (but they don‚Äôt serve it everday) and bread puddin served during breakfast. It‚Äôs nice that breakfast starts early at 6, so guests have time to eat in case there is an early activity (scuba diving for me). I had tried room service and loved the pancit palabok!

"Best hotel I've ever stayed at. We had a truly perfect time at the Savoy. It's on the opposite side of the island to the main tourist area, white beach etc, which meant it felt quieter, more relaxed. We split our trip and spent half here and half at station 2 to experience both sides.   Staff Our time at Savoy was exceptional. The staff there really did make the experience world class, so friendly, attentive and helpful.  Room The room was lovely, had a balcony overlooking the pools which was good. Comfy bed and pillows. Rooms were kitted out really well with all essentials plus extras like sandals, robes, complimentary water.  Food The complimentary breakfast buffet is really nice.

My partner and I really enjoyed our stay in Savoy Boracay. The place looks fresh and the vibe is very relaxing. Plus they have a nice pool and a private beach which is very serene. The food is also good especially the steak burger. But I think the major highlight of our stay  would be their staff. They are very helpful and friendly. They always smile and come to you to ask if you need anything. I would like to give a special mention to Robbie from front desk. He is really a good man. He helped and assisted us all through out our stay. Truly our stay in Savoy is remarkable.,5,May 2019

We also stayed at a couple of other properties near white beach so we did compare our experience of staying here with them.  We enjoyed our stay here for the most part and liked spending time by the poolside however beyond this there are no other entertainment/dining options nearby unless you take the 30 min journey to D-mall. The hotel does try to fill this void by having an hour long activity or event planned for each day of the week however we did not experience these sessions.

The hotel is located in the north of Boracay where you can also find the golf course and 3 private beaches facing to the east. This is means that you always have a wind blowing from December to June. This makes a long beach walk very pleasant. From the beach you can see 3 islands in the vicinity of Boracay. The great  thing with the beach is that there are only a few people around. Those who like to walk can go up the hill to see the shop house district and the golf course. The hotel itself is very nice with delicous food in the restaurants.,5,April 2019

"The hotel is sold as having its own private beach. This is accessible via a golf buggy/van driven by hotel staff. This was a good touch and added to comfort level, it is subject to availability though. Only on one occasion was a golf buggy not available, it‚Äôs only a 5 minute walk down hill on the way so not too much of an issue. The beach has a small drinks bar - if it belongs to the hotel because it‚Äôs private then the bar should mirror the same prices as the hotel but they‚Äôre more expensive? Also not convinced at how private the beach actually is as it looked as though a tour turned up one day.   Had the premium room which was a good sq size. Bathroom I don‚Äôt think is 4* standard.

If you want to head to the stations, you can easily hop on one of their free shuttles which run regularly. Or an etryc or tricycle which we took every day for a fee.

"My friend and I just spent couple of nights at Savoy Hotel whichu was a little bit too much for us! The hotel is newly built and everything is modern and airy. The pool is ok and after 2-3pm is hard to find a spot with sun for sunbathing hence we headed to the beach just down the road (walking distance) which is served by free shuttle. The beach is absolutely stunning not too big but great size with some rocks on both  ends which adds some interest for pictures. Sadly, when Ellen and I decided to have a stroll by the water we noticed that the beach isn‚Äôt actually very clean... in fact very dirty from littering like plastics and other litter coming from the sea!

"Best hotel to stay.  Book for 5days & 4nights in a Premiere Deluxe room with a view of their private beach.  Best hotel for many reasons: warm greetings, welcome drinks, they allowed us to early check-in which I really appreciated so we can have time to rest. Our room was romantically set-up, also they gave us chocolates every night. The staffs of Vienne Lounge made a surprise birthday greetings, it was really flattering.  The hotel's private beach is so beautiful and wonderful, it's a quite place to relax, to walk and feel the fresh air coming from the ocean.  The pool has a crystal clear water, so much enjoyed a night swimming.  The food is so delicious, their buffet breakfast is perfect.

"Hotel & Room: My partner and I had a pleasant stay here for 6 nights in the huge executive suite with a great view of the pool (2 bathrooms, 1 divided bedroom/lounge). At first we experienced a few issues with noisy neighbours as some rooms are joined by thin walls, but special thanks to friendly manager John for being so patient and helping us ""room hop"" to find the perfect, quiet room! The only thing I can fault is the water pressure and temperature, as the bathroom taps sprayed water everywhere during use and the hot water was sometimes lukewarm at best. Other than that it was a great room! The hotel itself looks very modern, with an enormous and clean lobby.

"Tried out Savoy for one night. Room was spacious with complete amenities and a great view although i found the bathroom quite small.Room service was served promptly and food was good. Did not really slept well as you can hear everything that was happening at the hall way. I even heard cleaners very early in the morning. You will also hear furniture moving on the room above you. Disappointed that they did not work on sound proofing the rooms. Breakfast was regular, staff were great. Just didn‚Äôt feel comfortable due to table set up was round tables good for 8, so very most likely you will share a table, awkward and it would make some feel like to rush breakfast.

My travel from Kalibo to Caticlan was smooth that turned chaotic once we were in Caticlan jetty port. I remained positive so as not to ruin my vacation.  Upon arrival at the hotel, we went straight for dinner. This is my 2nd time in Savoy and the dinner buffet selection was a welcome treat coming from an exhausting transfer.  The staffs were friendly and conversant and were comforting by checking on how our trip was and suggested things to do and places to visit in Boracay.  I had a good night sleep as we were welcomed with a cookie and a welcome note from the GM. The pillows were fluffy and the queen sized bed was to our liking.

There‚Äôs a regular free shuttle service to D‚ÄôMall (by McDonalds) that runs way more frequently that the schedule which was very beneficial for us and the other guests. The hotel has a nice private beach too but you can walk a little further to the Fairways one which is a little bit nicer, in our opinion! These beaches were very windy being January.

Our bath robes were comfortable and an added bonus. I can‚Äôt say enough about the staff. It is very obvious that the employees love their jobs.

The staff were very nice and courteous esp those in charge with the pool/kayak (Sorry we didnt get his name). Amenities were great esp the pool as it was sparkling clean.  CONS: There was a mixed up on the meet up/drop off point from Andoks to Mcdo. Reception has no system on how to queue incoming guests. Buffet last Thursday was not that great due to limited choices. Limited shuttle to and from main beach and no system on how to line up guests.  Will I come back? Definitely.,4,December 2018

Joy and her team, Jed, Rowen and all do an excellent job in the gym and pools, keeping a close watch on all. Very helpful on the beach too with canoes and local advice.  The negative was the ocean pollution, too much plastic floating whilst snorkeling, but the beach was well maintained for ‚Äúwinter‚Äù season.  We would easily stay again.",4,December 2018

Very good and fresh air. The landscape is nice and lots of green garden and the place is quiet. I also like the breakfast and the swimming pool. I also like the free shuttle service. I like outside golf and the bed.,5,April 2018
"My sister and I went went there last March 17-19 for 2 nights. Upon arrival, the concierge and the receptionist named Anna greeted us with a warm smile. The concierge didn't let us to bring our own luggage :) We checked in around 4pm but the room is not yet ready so we decided to eat first since we are very hungry. The sisig pizza is superb! all the staffs in the cafe is very attentive and friendly but I wasn't able to get their names, so sorry. After eating, the receptionist Anna informed us for a free room upgrade, Thank you :) and our luggage was already sent to our rooms!

We had our family lunch there last week and we enjoyed it so much! The waitress named GHAY was very friendly and accommodating. She told us what food is best and she knows how to make the customer feel at home and welcome. The ambiance is worth a high-end hotel! The place is over-all magnificent and we stayed there for hours and enjoy our awesome drinks by the pool after having our luscious lunch!,5,March 2018
This place is 30 mins away from station 2 and 20 mins away frm station 1.  So if your looking to soak in the sun and enjoy the beach...i wouldnt suggest staying here.  They have their own small private beach but its nothing compared to station 1 sand.  Their free shuttle service sucks as they dont even have it every hour...and it will be a 10 min walk to get to the beach front of station 2.  If you want to hire your own e-trike to get to places it will at least cost u us$5-6 per way.  The only reason why its worth staying here is its price and great service! Buffet breakfast is good enough also.,3,March 2018
"We are on the 5th Floor overlooking the swimming pool.  Best comfortable beds, cleanliness is iimpecable, but the best is our housekeepers Cecile and Krilla who made us feel special and welcome.

We got the premier relaxing room, which is on the 6 floor and with the see view! It was amazing to see that wonderful blue coast, like a real good morning!

"Savoy Hotel is a new hotel. Its is located quite far from the main beach of Boracay at Station 2. This may please guests who prefer a nice and quiet hotel. There are free hotel van to bring guests to Station 2 stopping at the large Jollibee Restaurant. As all the roads of Boracay are narrow, there are no big buses in the island. Each van could only take about 10-12 passengers. Imagine a group of 60 tourist waiting for the free shuttle? Can be quite chaotic.  The hotel has a private beach about  10 -15 minutes walk away but one can always ask for a golf cart to bring guests to the beach. The beach has no large trees with shade so it can be hot during the daytime. For sunbather, this is great. Although the beach looks clean, there were much plastic pollutant pieces in the sea.

"I stayed 2 nights at the Savoy to get away a little bit of the noise at white beach. The checkin was very fast and professional. Restaurant and pool bar was fine. And again the friendliness of the service was great. Rooms are super modern and clean. There is everything what you need. At this point I want to mention Anne from the front desk. She helped me with everything in a super professional, efficient and service oriented way. Even everyone was great - but Anne was the best.

"I went to Boracay to enjoy my friendship trip with my friends. The Hotel Savoy was very nice in all ways because it has good facilities and sea.

"We were on the island for a wedding and choose to stay here for the last few days to get away from the bustle of White Beach.  Initial impression were very good, obviously there is still construction going on but this was indicated on their website.  Room are new and very comfortable.  Pools are ok but with limited loungers for such a large hotel and poor table service.  Beach is a 10min walk away and there only loungers and some bean bags here.  No attendants for towels and no bar facility.    Our main let downs were the food and customer service.  The first night at dinner we were told there was no seafood available (this made up 50% of the menu), initially we were told this was a supply issue but later found out it was because it was all being used for a conference beach‚Ä¶",2,February 2018

I had to asked one by one of the restaurant to make me food like a beggar. Even refused to make me a pasta reason being , ‚Äúwe only surge buffet ‚Äú and pasta out of stock.

"Arrived 13th January but we had considered cancelling this hotel due to some negative reviews. The hotel was everything we had hoped for, its modern, clean and the staff are so friendly. The breakfast ( in the upstairs dinning room) was great with a good selection of cold and hot buffet. Rooms were clean and spacious and we had a sea view- Slightly interrupted by some building works going on but that didn't bother us, in fact we were rather entertained by the pre work exercise routine carried out by the construction workers (emphasises their work ethics) . The hotel is, as the name suggests on the Newcoast which is opposite side to White Beach and about 20 minutes away. The private beach, however is only a 5 minute walk and its so beautiful with staff working hard to keep it‚Ä¶",5,January 2018
"We arrived early morning of Sunday, February 11, 2018. We knew the standard check-in time but they managed to get a room for us around 4AM and it was a complimentary. The entire property is huge and fit for a family getaway. We had our buffet breakfast the next day and food choices can be improved except for the pastries. Kudos to Pastry Chefs! We enjoyed eating the slice breads with butter and orange marmalade. We went to the beach area. It was clean and peaceful though life guard must be seen at all times. We will be staying again end of April 2018. Just in time for LaBoracay 2018.",5,February 2018

"Poor customer service, expensive food and your order takes forever to arrive!! location not accessible to establishments, poor wifi signal and small rooms! I cannot count the numerous times their staff needed to apologize to their guests for all the inconvenience they‚Äôve experienced throughout their entire stay... You cannot blame the staff because the Mangement is the only one to blame. Not paying your staff‚Äôs overtime will greatly affect how they work!   If you wish to ruin your vacation, get a headache and waste your money, book at Savoy! ",1,February 2018
Location: It's like your going on a Retreat house for Recollection. Transportation is difficult. Construction everywhere.  Check In: There system is not in sync with their online reservation. Took almost 3 hours to get a room which has already been occupied and another hour to correct it.  Rooms: It's so small.   Plumbing: Their toilets don't have P-traps so your room smells like Boracay. Actually the whole building smells.   Breakfast: Come early like really early. Or else you'll only have a choice of pansit and water.  Restaurant: Took an hour to cook a burger and forever to cook real food.  Room Service: Food is cold.   Laundry and Dry Cleaning services: Took days.  Beach: No beach.

My friend brought me here to relax a couple of days. The hotel is really nice. Beds are comfortable and staff are friendly. They have free wifi and a gym. The pool is nice and they serve food outside. They have a shuttle bus that takes you around. Loved the private beach down the street. They schedule airport shuttles and were so nice and gave us umbrellas when it rained. ,4,February 2018
"They say Boracay is too commercialized and getting a private place to hold a major event will entail you to rent an island exclusively or pay an arm or a leg to get what you envision. They say it‚Äôs not possible, I had a major event and i spent 4 days and 3 nights in this property, in a nutshell SAVOY Boracay did not disappoint from start to finish. Below is my review of all property itself. What is GOOD Location: If you are into peace and quiet, tranquil beach setting this is the place for you. Located in a master planned development, you have access to your own beach! You can shout out loud (in the beach) and nobody will bother you.

It became a little too tight but if you get an executive room, then all is good (we only had the standard room). We got a view of the ocean from our room, except for the construction happening, it was relaxing. I have mixed reviews on the daily housekeeping. My parents said that when housekeeping came to clean their room, only half of their floor was swept. The same happened for our room so for the next couple of days, I made sure to be in the room when the housekeeper came and tell the housekeeper to sweep the entire room floor.

"Rooms are small, no king size beds in the hotel. Too many rules like aircon cannot be adjusted or switched off in your room . Can only be done by staff.  Generator noise all the time and exhaust fumes enter some of the rooms.  Hotel does not have direct access to the beach, however there is a shuttle to the beach or you can walk.

It‚Äôs clear these were merely teething problems, for what is a newly built hotel. As a result the manager and his staff were appreciative of the feedback, all of which was taken on board.

The staff was always ready to help with a smile. I fell sick during my stay at Boracay and needed urgent assistance. The hotel staff was very helpful in immediate basically medical help and getting me to the hospital. The rooms were lovely and clean and well equipped. The other services were questionable.  Hotel breakfast is below expectation. Room service calls at times went unanswered during busy times.,4,December 2017

To get into the main beach areas you need to get a shuttle, this was always overcrowded and takes around 30 mins due to bad traffic and roads. To come back, I had to get a taxi every night.

Negatives   We booked day tripping for 870 php. We were given the wrong time for the shuttle so had to pay for a cab. We arrived and they said there was no space. We got in and was taken to a separate pool from the guests where there was renovations going on. We swam in the pool to be told 3 hours later it was not suitable for swimming due to dirt and chemicals. It took 45 mins to pay for our bill due to countless errors and slow staff at the bar.

"Located at the quiet-peaceful side of the island with its own private beach with a semi bar, Savoy is your ultimate mind time-out. It took a while for my senses to calm down but when it did, well.. This side of Boracay is not the side I‚Äôm used to. There are no parties here, no fire dancers, no noisy bars nor loud music. But if it got too quiet for me, i just hopped on the shuttle to get to the front beach. It‚Äôs nice to know that I could always go back to calm that is Savoy.  They were still on their soft-launch when we went so I wasn‚Äôt expecting great food choices. The Spa isn‚Äôt open yet, too. So i look forward to coming back when everything is in place.

Staff were very accommodating, food during buffet breakfast was satisfying, cleanliness was good and recommendable, interior of room was simple and neat.  Just some recommendations.

"I have stayed quite recently at Savoy Boracay with friends. We have stayed only for 2 nights and regretted it. We should have stayed longer!   Being in Boracay for numerous times already, Savoy was a breath of fresh air from the normal bustle of Boracay's station 1-3. You really don't need to leave the hotel to enjoy Boracay as they have numerous things available for you like a beach nearby where they will glady take you by golf cart, there's a gym that is open very early until late at night, 2 dining outlets which offer happy hour throughout the day, and of course 2 very large pools right in the middle of the hotel.

Savoy had an awesome menu. They had vegetarian options which I hope they will grow and expound some more options. I suggest trying everything! Sad to say I don't have a big appetite any more to taste everything.  They had swimming pools that I can only imagine can be compared to 5-star hotels.

Being very honest, when we arrived we had a bad first impression as we faced a few issues: had to send our card information beforehand to guarantee the transfer to/ from hotel (which is something not all the hotels demand), had a quite slow check-in process and had to send an email to the hotel with our Booking.com reservation info - which is something that never happened before to us, as usually the hotels always have the confirmation and only need the reservation number. Also the machine wouldn't accept my card and surprisingly the hotel had no ATMs to withdraw money, but we were required to settle everything within the same day (which again is something that not all the hotels demand). So in the same day after‚Ä¶",4,October 2017
"I miss the old Boracay where roads weren‚Äôt congested, and where passageways going to the beach weren‚Äôt jam-packed. I‚Äôm all for boosting the isle‚Äôs tourism and progression. But it was a bit of an eyesore to see so many construction sites sprouting up like mushrooms. I had a hard time recognizing certain areas that were so familiar before that I felt somewhat confined. It wasn‚Äôt the island vibe that I was longing to experience, as sceneries have definitely changed since I visited 3 years ago. So imagine how refreshing it was to stay on the same islet but on a more quieter and calmer side of it. Given all of the major changes in the bustling side of Stations 1-3, I‚Äôm glad I found Savoy Hotel in Newcoast Boracay. You‚Äôd be surprised that such a place existed just 30 minutes away from‚Ä¶",5,September 2017
"Arrived in Kalibo Airport and have arranged hotel transfers through their reservation manager Andrew but had encountered some problems due to miscommunication maybe.Had to complain at the reception upon check in due to the inconvenience this had cause us. On our 2nd day, the Lady Manager Joy was very polite and I appreciated her gesture checking on us at the lobby. I have appreciated her humility that she had to apologized on the hotel's behalf and have promised that she will take good care of us during our stay. I have decided to extend my stay for a couple of days. The hotel is very new, but service and food at the restaurant needs to be improved. Staff are very polite and always smiling.

"I wrote a very negative review before out of anger. On reflection it was too one-sided. Let me show the pros and cons this time.  Pros- 1. The staff are excellent. From the front desk to the security to the restaurant workers. All were very warm, welcoming and helpful. A special mention to John. We had many problems but John always made great attempts to take care of us so thank you to him!  2. The restaurant food is quite nice too. We ate here a few times and were usually pleased and satisfied.   3. The hotel is clean and modern. The premises are well kept.  4. The pool area is large enough that you don't feel annoyed by rowdy guests.   Cons  1. The hotel is too far away from anything. You are very isolated. I don't know where the nearest shop is . No freedom to explore‚Ä¶",2,October 2017
"It seems every location in this hotel amazes me. Everywhere we go, even at D'mall, it is exclusively felt that Savoy staffs truly care for their guests and that made our stay extra special. I love the pool, surprisingly heated and it was raining that night so we doubly enjoyed swimming. Private beach itself is so peaceful and bean bed bags were fun and relaxing!",4,September 2017
"Together with my family, it's our first time to visit Boracay. We stayed in this newly built Savoy Hotel Boracay Newcoast. It's a 25 minute ride going to DMall where the beaches are located. At first I was a little disappointed because we still need to ride going to the beach, but when I found out that they have free shuttle service and that there is a beach near our hotel, just a five minute walk or a two minute shuttle ride, I was totally amazed since the beaches in DMall area are almost congested. In this private beach, we can relax and have fun with the family. It's picturesque view makes it so instagramable. Plus, the Savoy hotel staff are all very accommodating and friendly. I especially love their lounge area, very modern in style but with a touch of  classic Philippine‚Ä¶",5,August 2017
"Indeed Savoy Hotel Boracay brought us a colourful and memorable experience. Welcome drinks were served immediately before check-in. All staff from concierges, shuttle drivers, security, lifeguards and housekeeping were very accommodating and helped us out in all our needs. We would like to commend Mr. Ping, the head of security if I'm not mistaken, Mr. Lester and one of Savoy's shuttle driver (forgot to ask his name, sayang)  Room is so relaxing and clean with balcony and great view of nature. They provided us our own coffee/tea making facility. The comfort room is also spacious with complete toiletries.  The Cove 2, Savoy's private beach is so serene and breathtaking.

"First off, many thanks to ""Ms Attractive"" of Savoy Hotel Boracay, Ms Monica Layug, for making our hotel booking arrangement ""smooth like a silk"".  Hassle-free transport from Caticlan Airport and back, as we availed of the hotel's transport service for a fee. Front desk staff, especially Ms Rose, made our hotel check-in quick and effortless.  Every hotel staff made our stay truly great.  Wherever we were in the hotel, every hotel staff greeted us with a smile.  Services were exceptional, special mention to the shuttle drivers who accommodated us in all our transport requests.   We, as a family, stayed in three separate cozy deluxe rooms.  The private beach is truly picturesque and the pools impressive.  Sufficient and satisfying food choices in the restaurant, with very‚Ä¶",5,August 2017
"Savoy's ambience is really beautiful despite it not being completely finished yet and the rooms are well maintained, which I believe is really important after a long day of walking around and swimming. The service shuttle was definitely one of my favorite services the hotel offers since it is always punctual and the drivers are approachable and respectful. The staff was very accommodating as well. This was my first out-of-town trip with my friends and Savoy was definitely one of the reasons why I want to do it again. A huge thank you to Monica Layug for being really accommodating and for helping set up the rooms my friends and I stayed in!!",5,August 2017
This place is amazing! A place where you can relax and have fun at the same time. Staff are always smiling and very warm which makes you feel comfortable all the time. Special thanks to Ms. Monica Layug for the arrangements and fast response to all our inquiries prior to arriving at the hotel. Food at the cafe are really good as well. Great job everyone! :),5,August 2017
"Truly recommend Savoy as it is well managed and perfect for any type of get togethers! This place is very peaceful and the staff are very accommodating! The service is also quick, flexible, and organized. A friend of ours got an asthma attack and the medical service was quick and they did not leave us until they were sure that she was [really] well. Our group also wished to watch movies that we have downloaded and the staff made it possible!! In a addition, the place also offers a free shuttle going to station 2 and going back to the hotel every hour. This one was my favourite as we used this service a lot.    Giving my special mention for Monica Layug as she extended her efforts in making sure that we are booked and taken care of!  Definitely one of the places I'd recommend‚Ä¶",5,August 2017

Visited the new Savoy Hotel on Boracay! Rooms are lovely. Foyer is designed in great colors. Pool looks good. Will be a good place to stay when it's all open! No AC in the foyer and lounge makes it a little steamy! Friendly staff! ,3,August 2017

"I stayed for  a business trip last month for 3 nights and it's a perfect  venue if you are looking for a quite and relaxing place to stay. I had an amazing pool view  and outdoor Jacuzzi was very inviting, nice facilities and food. Staff were  polite and  approachable  till the day I checked out. FOM, FM and transport staff were awesome.  The location is on the other side  but they have a hourly regular shuttle going  to  the ""D Mall"" and every 45 mins trip back to the hotel.",4,July 2017
"1. Stayed for 3 days and 2 nights. It is a mixed of vacation and work since we held our annual planning in this hotel/resort. 2. Their food is surprisingly good. Tried their soups, chicken (inasal and herb), and desserts. 3. Staff (hotel and restaurant) are very friendly and accommodating. 4. Their function room is very spacious. 5. The lobby lounge is nicely decorated and very relaxing to hang out. This is my favorite spot in the hotel/resort. 6. Breakfast buffet is okay. Not too many choices though. 7. They have free shuttle going to D' Mall (vice versa) on an hourly basis. Last trip is at 12nn. 8. If you miss the last trip from D' Mall to Savoy Hotel (12:25am), you can take a tricycle but it costs Php 200.  9. The pool is nice. Quite big compared to other beach front hotels.‚Ä¶",5,August 2017

Their customer service is excellent, the team of staff went out of their way to help.  I must commend the front desk, restaurant staff, concierge and management team. Specially thanks I to AJ, Aeron, Anne, And Erwin for ensuring I had an amazing experience. So much so I brought 17 of my family and friends here for a day trip on 30th July. Like me they thoroughly enjoyed the secluded and private beach, relaxing swimming pool and sumptuous food and beverages. Yes there are still constructions going on in the area however it didn't bother us at all.  I'm so glad I discovered a new home In Boracay. I hope to be back soon! ",5,July 2017
"Still some construction going on but as it is, no rough edges.  Simply faultless!  The excellent:  1) Customer service is unparalleled, and I am talking of all areas / all departments.  Compared to the (top) 5-star hotel in Makati CBD - corner of Ayala and Makati Avenue - where service is supeficial and staff are indifferent, Savoy waxes them by a mile, no make that a hundred; 2) Location is outside the main party strip which is ideal for families or those who prefer peace and quiet.  Relaxing views to boast:  fairway, hills, and beach; 3) Shuttle service to and from the main strip every hour, and to its own private beach which is also reachable by foot; 4) The Cove is its private beach where water is calm, sand is still distinctly Boracay, and away from the crowd.

"When we say Boaracay, we imagine white sand, pristine waters and endless crowd.   What a great surprise it is to discover that an exclusive village-resort that is Newcoast is now here to cater for those who prefer quiet time than the noisy crowd. From the sloping ridge as you enter the property, your first glance of Savoy is breathtaking; with the mountains and ocean as backdrop. The private beach makes you feel like you own the place, it is awesome! Spent hours everyday there.  The resort is altogether very colorful, very playful - you can't help but just relax. The Party Pool is super fun. Above all, the staff are great and friendly. They go out of their way to make you feel comfortable. Thank you, Savoy! Cannot wait to visit again!",5,June 2017
"Spending time with your beloved in the paradise that is Boracay is more enjoyable when it's more intimate and exclusive. That was how I felt when we transferred to Savoy Hotel Boracay. After the obligatory stay at the white beach, my better half made arrangements to stay in this piece of paradise. Situated inside the township project of Megaworld at Boracay Newcoast, Savoy offers a blissful retreat via their well appointed rooms and hotel amenities. We were greeted by friendly staff that assisted us during our stay. They have this welcome cookies that was so yummy.   The main pool was so inviting that I had to do my laps that instance.

Savoy gives a very relaxing and peaceful stay in Boracay although away from the nightlife. Their staff is really nice and will make you feel special and will always greet you with a smile.

To match with that, the service was excellent! The staff, all helpful and jolly at all times. The general manager himself would even attend to the guests to make sure that they are enjoying their stay.  And the food? Heavenly! Filipino dish from their all-day breakfast menu is highly recommended, but everything they serve you is sure to make you smile.",5,June 2017

The place is in the quiet side of boracay; the hotel itself is beautiful- lobby is colorful and vibrant,  rooms are spacious with great view of the sea. There are 2 big pools, plus kiddie pool and a warm spa to boot. The gym is great and the instructor very accomodating. But just a little distance from the hotel, the secluded white sand beach beckons!       Food is great- our fave is the Fil breakfast! But chef prepared a buffet on our last day, and so now we are confused which is the best! Best of all, the staff are so friendly and helpful. They made us feel so special.

Beautiful price beach where you are almost all time alone not like in station 1 and this side. One day I hade buffer breakfast which was nice second day they offer me a la carte menu because we was just 3 people in all hotel. Personal was so kind and transit to D-mall was perfect. Philippines candy was nice surprise in my room after arriving. I try restaurant downstairs it was good just portion was small. There is still space to improve for example I ask for zip line and they said me is possible but they will charge me 1000 fee for transport one way (it's 1km far away from that hotel) so I walk there but in hotel like this I will expect more‚Ä¶,4,May 2017

On arrival the staff at the front desk and the bell boys were super friendly. They provided a cold towel and a welcome drink which was needed after the journey. The check-in process was longer than I'd ever experienced (I had previously emailed the hotel to ask to extend our stay which was confirmed in an email but was not on their record) this could have easily been streamlined.

"The location of Savoy is great and bad at the same time. It's great because it's far from the crowd and it has access to one of the cleanest and nicest beaches of Boracay.  Its bad because it's built in an area that is still undeveloped and therefore you don't have any food or entertainment option within walking distance.   You are totally dependent on hotel transportation to go anywhere and that's generally not a good thing. The hotel staff are well trained and very welcoming. Rooms are ok, too dense in my opinion, it feels like a busy city condominium (someone might say a hospital) rather than a beach resort.",4,May 2017
