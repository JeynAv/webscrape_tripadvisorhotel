"1. You’ll be surprised as to how many trainees they have- a looooot as in a looot all over the hotel, bellman, restaurant, HK 2. The hotel was kind enough to let us in earlier than the check in time. We were assisted in the room by the trainee.  3. I was shocked at first when I was told that there is no wifi in the room cause I have to work. But good thing it was working but it was a bit weak. It was better past midnight.  4. Expect that there’s a lot of people for bfast Since it is a beach front property and the price is cheap, a lot of locals are staying here.  Bfast was not slow even if there’s a lot of people.  Kimchi is too spicy though. I love kimchi so I think they have to improve the taste. I also didn’t like the egg as it does not taste 100% real egg.  5. Check out - wait for Hk clearance 6. Better to bring your own towel when staying here.  7. Good location- beach front Near 7 eleven 8. They have a pool but we didn’t have time to swim.   Good stay…",4,April 2023
"My family and I stayed at La Carmela for only 1 night, and thankfully so.  Upon entering the room, you immediately notice the dated look of the room. Colors used made the room look dark, and it reminded me of budget motels in Metro Manila.  The trash bins in the room looked very much like waste bins you would see at a public place--green/red/yellow plastic. The shower head in the bathroom was broken--it was spewing water out from both ends.  There was also barely any reception in the room. We also experienced a power outage during our short stay at the hotel.  Their complimentary breakfast might be the saddest I have ever encountered. They were offering plain congee, and it literally was just cooked rice diluted with water.  I don't think I could have survived more than our overnight stay.  I do hope they can modernize the place since they have so many guests staying over--I think they'll be able to afford it. Until then, I'll be skipping La Carmela indefiitely.…",2,February 2023
"Room was good, however needs sound proofing especially that it was just accross the generator set.  Buffet breakfast have good choices of food, however, coffee was bland. The paper tag placed around your wrist during meals was just annoying.  Due to uncontrolled number of guests, there is quiet a long queue when checking in/out of the hotel.",4,January 2023
This is the only hotel that I have experienced to have a cockroach in it. To think that I have just checked in an I have no foods inside the room. I am very disappointed and I feel like I was ripped off. I am jus glad that I had booked a 1 night stay. Never again! Not recommended at all.,1,December 2022
"Superb location and accessible to the beach . The breakfast food buffet was definitely worth it. The room was nice and cozy. It has an elevator which is good for easy accessibility. The downside is that they don't give you an OFFICIAL RECEIPT, this is for reimbursement. The front desk receptionist was adamant about it and not very polite about that situation wherein she could have handled it more professionally.",3,October 2022
"I booked this thru online.   We we're expecting a lot from La Carmela since Sir Boy Abunda keeps on promoting this hotel during all his tv shows.   Anyway, if you can try to have more budget on your accommodation, pls pls don't book here at La Carmela. They will assign your room on their VERY OLD building.   We cannot transfer to other hotel since its already fully booked.  So we asked them if we can just have a room upgrade and will pay extra. We we're transferred to a better room and a better building.  Anyway, below are some helpful items before you book this hotel.  1. Globe signal is very low on the rooms.  2. Wifi only available on common areas (lobby and dining area).  3. FO (Front Office) staff and their FO head are not accommodating. It looks like they are not enjoying their job. We didn't hear any apology when we  raised our room concerns.   4. On our first day, we requested for a wake up call and we didn't receive any call. Again, we didn't hear any apology from them.  5. Wide variety of breakfast, but no taste at all. No bacon, no choice of egg (other than scrambled) and the hotdog tastes like a very cheap brand. Knowing that their standard/premiere room price starts at Php 2,500++ per night.  6. Hotel is located on station 2, but almost on station 3. So far.  7. Incomplete set up on rooms. We have to call FO for towels. The FO staff who answered was just saying ""Uh huh, yes"" sounds like she don't know what she's doing.   We we're so frustrated to think that my companion and I are working in the hotel industry for almost 9 yrs, that is why we know  how you should treat the guests.   La Carmela should take seriously these reviews and know how to improve their hotel and the attitude of their Front Office staff.…",2,October 2022
"We booked a week here but stayed only one night and canceled the rest.  When we arrived hungry and tired they could not find our reservation and held us up for almost 3 hours Before agreeing to give us a room at the regular rate for the first night.  We booked our reservation through AGODA but AGODA said in an email later that night the hotel had refused to honor the reservation. The rooms in our part of the hotel looked like something from the late 1960’s, The air conditioning was noisy and we saw a live roaches in the bathroom. The entrance is in A narrow alleyway Barely white enough for three wheeler. The beach was a long Walk from the room which wasn’t really great since I am due for a knee replacements on both knees. The furniture is old and wore And the beds not too comfortable. We booked a week here but stayed only one night and canceled the rest.

"Having spend the night before in Hennan Park Resort this review maybe a bit skewed. Price wise I am going to assume La Carmela is much lower costs. The exact costs I don't know as it was part of a package. It is a bit of a dated hotel. Room is OK for 3 stars. Bed are like thick Uratex but OK. There is a fridge and waterheater but no amenities like coffee or tea. Our room has a small private balcony with two (uncomfortable) chairs and table. In the room no chairs although there is space. Aircon (window type) cooled OK but noisy. Bathroom outdated but shower strong and warm. Shower did almost overflow as there is no threshold and little slope to the drain. Towels were small and worn. The resort is right at the white beach with in front of the premises a small pool. Too small for the size of Carmela. But hé the beach is 25 meters more and that's why you are in Boracay. Breakfast was buffet style with mainly Filipino choices.Quite busy and you are requested to give your preferred time slot for your breakfast to stagger the crowd. For western not so many choices. One fruit, there is basic cereal and simple slices of bread. For good breakfast you have to go Filipino. There is no bar at the hotel (unless I missed it) but enough choices walking distance.  …",3,October 2022
"I was sponsoring a family of 9 for 3 BR for a 5D/4N stay so I called the hotel to pay for the reservation.  To my surprise, I was told to send a remittance money as a mode of transaction!  I have transacted in the past with Shangrila as well as Coast Boracay and never had any issues transacting either over email or phone.  This is the first time I am transacting with La Carmela and the service from the start is unbelievably dumb!   I guess there's a reason why review of this hotel stands at 3.  I wouldn't be surprise if the rating further sinks down to a 1.  Don't stay in this hotel... look somewhere else.",1,August 2022
No wifi in the rooms.only in the lobby No slippers provided Pillows smell like old  stock from cabinet it is not fresh smelling linens and bedsheets. No smoking in the resort but does not provide smoking areas,1,August 2022
"My third time going to Boracay, my first time was in Fairways & Bluewater Resorts, however it was too far, 2nd time we stayed in Villa De Oro, and for my third time, we stayed here at La Carmela. Our stay here at La Carmela was a clutch decision but a truly memorable one. We celebrated New Year's Eve 2022 at La Carmela. We stayed there for 9 nights. But I must say, some employees are not that dedicated and passionate with what they do, except for the security personnel who were all very accommodating. I myself, I am a front office agent, I can't even feel the sincerity with the service they provide.   I was actually expecting a lot from La Carmela since Mr. Boy Abunda has always been promoting this resort during all his shows, in addition to that, so many celebrities and even…",3,January 2022
"Was booked here by Travel agent. Location is awful, had to drag luggage from main road to get to hotel. Website says beachfront blatant lie 10 min walk to beach. Room awful, staff awful. Of course no refunds. After waiting 3hrs finally room available. Beds awful room awful. We left and went to Fairways and Bluewater resort, cost was just a few peso more. Worth every penny.",1,June 2022
"Went to Boracay with my family of 10pax (2kids) from Thursday to Sunday morning. In this review I will emphasize some important points to consider NOT to book this hotel if you want a relaxing Boracay vacation:   Point 1: Their booking price does not include transfers from Boracay airport to hotel. Being budget hotel their price does not include transfers from airport (van-ferry-van) to hotel which other hotels already include. If you are traveling with several luggages especially with kids, better book a hotel which includes door to door transfer since this can be major hassle. For our group this is an additional 1,200php per head (10k total) which can just be used to book a better hotel.  Point 2: Their hotel is crowded, even the hotel lobby is small. Again since this is a…",1,May 2022
We celebrated my mother's birthday in Boracay and booked 2 rooms in La Carmela and we're lucky enough to be upgraded. It's a 3 to 5 minutes walk to the beach and also has a pool. We weren't able to experience the pool in the front part because it's jam-packed with guests but the one on the east wing is empty so the kids were able to take a dip. We had a great time staying there.,5,June 2021
"0 star hotel, everything is dirty, toilette and shower everything has molt (schimmel), ac is loud and stinks, window is towards a roof and stinks outside, breakfast only 2 out of 4 menus available and it tastes bad. Breakfast costs 250php, dont buy it, its a **** hole.",1,April 2022
"Reminder when staying in a budget friendly hospitality venue , expect to get what you pay for . Here are some nice to know.,  1) poor amenities, such as a small bar soap , with no dental kits . No slippers.So bring your own stuff .  2) there is hot water option in the shower , strong pressure  3) wifi is very erratic,  4) aircon noisy but can cool evetually 5) breakfast is not buffet , plated deals that change daily  6) some staff are efficient, others are not",3,March 2022
"Dusty rooms, don't bother to clean before guest check in. Water dispenser was at the first floor, and our room was at the fourth floor. Why not put water dispenser per floor, too tired of going up and down.  No buffet breakfast unlike before. Please go and find another hotel that will provide better service.",1,February 2022
"Stayed here for total of 4 nights, 2 rooms. Nothing really much to say coz most of the time were outdoor.  Room - nothing special. Just enough for the price i paid.  But i like the pressure of the water in the shower perfect for rinsing after your outdoor activities.  Aircon is a bit noisy but cold which os okay for me.  Restaurant - food in their breakfast is so so…. But having a polite and attentive staff makes us feel good. Good job guys for showing your hospitality.   Pool - wonderful! Facing the beach makes it extra luxurious and instagramable! Though i suggest that life guard should put some smile in his face to be more appealing to the guest and not think that he is snob.  Staff - Overall, they are completely fine.   Will o come back in this property nextime? Maybe yes,…",3,January 2022
"If you are trying to get a buck out of 299 for dinner buffet, I guess this will be it.  The whole selection is just meh. But the whole dining area is hot. Still happy to reminisce the joy of being a former La Carmela guest.",3,October 2021
This hotel is really nice. This is the second time I stayed here with friends. Also the staff are all hospitable. They always make sure that all the rooms and areas were well-sanitized. I recommend you to try their amenities as well. I will surely be back here soon.,5,June 2021

"We stayed for a day before we transferred to Henann Prime. Room was decent for the price, airconditioning was not that cold, breakfast was kind of typical and simple but turned out great. Customer service was not so great. (I left a gray polo shirt on the cabinet, returned the next day to get it from lost and found but cleaners claimed it was not there. Pretty sure It was tho.)",3,March 2021
"Affordable yet quality customer service. My husband & I checked in from feb 2-6, 2021. All we need were given right away especially when my husband got sick. A van was there to help us go to the hospital & the manager even gave us food, gatorade & banana for my husband's recovery upon our check out. Food was great for those who are not ""maarte"". They also offered us to move to a new room since we just knew i was pregnant for me to avoid getting exhausted from walking from building to another building. Thank you for showing sympathy to my husband even though its Henann's responsibility why he got sick. Thank you & continue to serve your customers well.",4,February 2021

You Can do a better service 😞😞😞 staff should know and have knowledge on the food. -Jinky Rivera",1,January 2021
"You will get the most value for your money staying here.  Cheap price but room is okay.  They give you a hygeine kit and daily set breakfast.  Location is the best since it is near everything.  Buffet dinner is also value for money.  Plus, they have 2 swimming pools that you can enjoy.",5,December 2020

Well the hotel is actually on a great spot. The room we had was an executive deluxe. It actually has a bathub but the bathub does not have the stopper where you can fill it with water hahaha. So the tub is never filled with water haha. The room we had is not that really wow. Its more like an old bldg and the buffet in the breakfast is just okay not the best hehe but since its the location is in a great spot and the people are still accomodating so still a great stay. Hehe. Still an experience. 😊,3,January 2020
We had both room # 201 and # 202 and one of the room had a bath tub but the other one which I and my husband had not...so we had some problem while taking shower. Because the drain in the shower/bathroom was not draining very well...and you had water everywhere. Another thing was the toilet ring which was not the right size for it! ,3,March 2020
"My brother in law booked 3 executive deluxe room last November 2019 for my mother in law 60th birthday last March 2. But due to the NCOV-19 issues that started to erupt from January until today, my mother in law decided to cancel it since he is scared considering among the 14 persons booked for the 3 rooms, 2 were senior citizens and 4 were kids which are considered has low immunity with regards to any illnesses. If we don't have senior citizens or kids in the group, then we might push through with our booking. But sad to say, the travel agency Traveloka initially says we need a proof of cancellation from our airline tickets before they can consider refund. But later on, the agency said that it was stated on the ticket that the reservation is nonrefundable. I personally respect…",1,March 2020

I told the receptionist that the phone in our room has no dialtone, i was just promised that they’ll have someone look into it but until our check out time no one has ever check on that phone. I had to go downstairs for every request that we need and had to remind the receptionist everytime about the phone. I asked about late checkout and was told it depends on availability, i understand.

If you want something cheap and right on the beach this place is for you. The rooms are tired but functional and clean with a nice little balcony. Wifi is non existent. If you’re a westerner you can survive on the free breakfast if you go eggs on toast. The three pools are are in very public areas. When I say public I mean people walking past looking in. I am a pool kinda guy and I did not take a dip once because the areas lacked that Resort feel. I would jump in the sea an hour before sunset and float around.  So there are three buildings in this complex and they are very busy probably because of the value for money. The place is over run by people.  Would I stay here again? It’s a positive’yes’. I would stay at a resort either end of the stay though to get that holiday feel…,4,November 2019

Before we answered, they showed us both the rooms (family room and semi-executive room) so we can choose. We liked the family room which was facing the pool, so we stayed there for 3 days.

Room service can't even accomodate every request of room cleaning. We had to follow up 3 times since they lack staff. Hope they can provide quality service regardless of their size. Given a chance, i would have chosen diffrent hotel. We can't transfer to a different hotel since they made sure that the online reservation made cannot be cancelled.

We got 4 rooms and was able to checkin at 2pm. The room was decent and was not cramped. But the other things inside the room was a no no for us.

Not like we want to see outside because our view is a moldy wall and a fence. the room was also full of mosquitoes which isn’t ideal in philippines.   Then there was five of us we had a room with two beds and when we ordered a third bed it didn’t come for about an hour, the room was insanely hot when we came as well and there is nothing in the fridge and there were no towels when we entered the room even though the room said it comes with four bath towels one hand towel and one foot towel.…",1,August 2019

Smell pie from aircon, so we complain and they change the unit, it got better after that, but still smell a lot of chemicals in the room.

It's very noisy, they all walk around with walkie talkies on high volume, staff talking loud in corridors, and this starting around 5 in the morning always.

We stayed for 4days/3nights July 4-july 7, 2019 under Travelonline. Everything was good except for wifi and the room is not a sound proof. you can even hear people talking in the corridor. The room is simple yet we don't mind since were not going to stay 24hrs in there. there were just not enough amenities such as slippers, toothbrush and a lotion. Even its only a standard room it should be provided. Also the wifi they said its free but for the whole duration of our stay we weren't able to use it. our own date is more useful.

"Boracay as an Island is amazing, the best beach ever in Philippines if not in asia and one of the top destination world wide. The hotel (La Carmela de Boracay) is cost effective and I recommend it. Dont try the breakfast it is too crowded but surrounding you there are other options.",4,November 2018
"We stayed here for 3 days, we had two rooms. The place is very nice and well kept. My only complaint is that for 3 days they had exactly the same breakfast day. This got old for me. I was hoping for some variety. The location is not bad, they have two locations, one is directly on the beach and other is not. I would have preferred a location on the beach, but we did not get that. When you book this place make sure you request a room located on the beach side.",3,July 2019

We arrive to the facility june 10 and the crew was very accomodating, It was a bit busy because a lot of people booking that day but they were able to accomodate us very well .  The room was spacious enough and we enjoyed or stay in the hotel .  We will soon visit Boracay and surely we will choose La Carmela de Boracay for our next stay .  Thank you ",5,June 2019
Worth the stay. Nice and delicious buffet breakfast. Hotel is really a front beach.Rooms are clean although towels are a bit yellowish but you can always ask for a new ones. Staff are corteous and polite. I will definitely go back to Bora and stay here @La Carmela👌👍🏼,5,June 2019
Stayed here 3 days and 2 nights. Staff is accommodating. Room is average with basic necessities. Not bad for its price. What I love about the hotel is the buffet. Super love the food! It is also very near to the beach (walking distance) and close to a lot of restaurants and bars. What I hated the most is the wifi connection because it was so intermittent when we were there and can only be accessed in some areas in the hotel (I cannot access the internet from our room). Globe data connection is also not good in the area. The elevator was also not working during our stay so we had to go up and down the 4th floor through the stairs.,4,May 2019
With all the bad reviews i have read about this place i was getting prepared for it. But what i experienced is the opposite to what they say. First of all i was glad that we were upgraded to a four beds room accommodation located on the far end of the fourth floor which is good for aside from being private it is peaceful n quiet. The room was clean and complete with all the towels and toiletries. Cleanliness of the room depends on how you keep it clean. The staff were nice esp. when you are a nice person yourself. Since it is a big place so the dining area gets crowded during meals. Overall our stay here is good n enjoyable esp. it has a beach front and very near to many restaurants and establishments.,4,June 2019
We bought 4 nights stay for missionaries balikbayan... But they were not able to travel to Boracay and stay at LA Carmela de Boracay due to emergency medical reasons...

No full refund or even a portion of refund would be appreciated!,1,June 2019

Along with my family, we enjoyed the scenery , the ambiance and  of course the warm welcome from the la Carmela de Boracay Staff .  We like the room , it was good enough for a family . 2 beds and a cozy place to rest after a long walk from Station 2 and 3 . I will recommend the place to my friends and family members too , so they can experience the feeling being  pampered by this Hotel on their vacation and Island trip ... Thank you .... you made my birthday memorable . We will soon go back to Boracay .. and you will be my top choice for the place to stay .... #LaCarmelaDeExcellent",5,June 2019

She immediately asked for the key and voila the rings are gone.We reviewed the cctv after we have the cctv request letter from the Police Station.Only the floor leader entered the room.We asked them but they said that there's no rings to be found in the bathroom.She just got married last June 8,2019 and we checked out last June13,2019.How sad is that?!!Dont you ever leave your stuff here!!!Better find a decent hotel like Henann.I cant compare Henann regency to La…",1,June 2019

Our first day buffet dinner - all are salty except their watermelon for the dessert. 2nd day buffet dinner, beef mushroom is already spoiled. Their set breakfast -choice of 1] longanisa,rice and egg,2] ham,rice and egg 3] chicken,rice and egg. it's so wrong that i have chosen longanisa. the ground meat they use is already sour. Blankets, pillows and towels don't look fresh because instead of white its already greyish.

Old hotel but reasonably maintained.  Furnishings are a bit outdated but at least they are functional.  Staff needs to be trained to be more courteous and approachable.  Very Near the beachfront.  Elevator was under repair that time but it is ok.  Nice and spacious conference halls.,3,May 2019
"Where to begin!  Well the good thing is the location right close to the beach. However, the hotel rooms were filthy and poorly maintained. Our king bed was short sheeted as the hotel was using bedding meant for a double bed not a king bed. As soon as we checked in the shower drain was blocked. We got nasty bites every night from the bed and that lead to rashes all over us. During a brown out the hotel generator overheated so we had to endure no power for hours at a time. Lifts often not working. Staff very overworked and hardly ever smiling. Breakfast was difficult to access as the buffet was not sufficient for the amount of people using it daily. We ended up going outside the hotel for our breakfast.  I'm sad to have to say this but we were glad to leave Boracay after having…",1,May 2019

I commend Ana Mae and Leny in the Front desk who did the check in and out for us. They are very nice. We're looking forward to be back. Just a bit concern to add water in the room and a water kettle. Please improve also the Breakfast. But everything is nice the location and staff,4,May 2019

So, I just asked for towel changing and take some garbage out. About 3 days I had to follow up about room cleaning. -Even I went to front desk and asked them by myself to clean my room but, they also forgot to clean my room.

When we got our table already, we followed the line since there were manyyy people falling in line just to get food. Almost foods are empty already since no one controls and refill the foods.

When we were checking out, a housekeeper just entered the room without knocking and was forcing us to leave considering we actually even have one more day that we paid (cos we checked out early to move to a different hotel).

Family members staying in another room complained that they sometimes noticed a sewage smell.

"It’s hard to find a hotel in boracay with a good location near the beach, a good affordable value for money, and a pool as well. This was a very good choice indeed for everything that we were looking for. The beach is just in front of the other side of the hotel. Their pools were all kid-friendly but too shallow for adults. They also had a hotel to airport transport service with a fee. On the “Con” side they only had 2 free breakfasts for one room good for 4 and I couldn’t say they have the friendliest staff given that the hotel was always busy checking in and out lots of guests but overall they were effective on processing our requests. As they said if you want more then you have to pay more, this hotel is good for all classes ! 👍",4,April 2019
One of the best hotels in boracay. Everything you need in boracay are very accessible when you stay in la carmela. 7/11 and other small shops and souvenir stores are just within the area. Book your stay along with the buffet breakfast. You will surely love it. Enjoy the pool in the beachfront. ,5,April 2019

"For an average price for a hotel, this is hotel is in an excellent location...It's right in front of the beach.... Their swimming pool is very small but who needs a pool when you have the ocean...They have very good breakfast buffet....The staff can use more hospitality....",3,July 2017
"La carmela is for families that wants to spend most of the money on activities. Its very simple , quiet and for me relaxing. Though wifi is a little bit of an issue and some rooms have no views its still   a great place to stay in... They have pools, massage parlors and spots to sit and relax , its near the beach .. a spacious dinning area that is for me very affordable , staff is always smiling and very helpful... When the clean up of boracay is done ill definately visit again",4,September 2017
We choose to stayed in La Carmela de Boracay. Upon arrving at the hotel we are welcomed by their smiling staff and assist us nicely. They also served different kinds of cuisine. Their staff is very accomodating and friendly.,5,June 2017
We stayed here last July 2016 for 4 days and 3 nights. The room is very basic. The food is so-so. The plus point of this hotel is it's very near from the sea and it has it's own pool. They have some sort of entertainment during dinner. ,3,May 2017
"The staffs are friendly and accommodating, very accessible, near the beach, clean room and quiet. got affordable price during our stay. have pools inside and budget restaurant. Don't attempt bringing out stuffs they're strict on inventories.",4,May 2017
"Is a very sad looking hotel. Sad bedsheets, sad pillows, sad bathroom. So, I cannot complain since its cheap right? Is near all the eateries and drinking places. 3 mins walk to the beach. Staffs are okay. No water bottles served. In the shower are, expect to put all your toiletries on the floor, I stayed in room 410, the aircond is so noisy. One unique thing about this hotel is, the lift. Other than that... Nothing to shout out. ",2,April 2018
"The hotel is on the beach front, you can sleep then swim then run to your room to sleep again. Vacay for 3 days and was worth it! even though i'm writing a reviewer for a year and so. i remember and eat all you can breakfast with cereals, bread and toast, pancakes and fried egg omelette.",4,December 2017
We can't complain much for the quality of the food for 300php buffet price. It was ok. Loads of people on queue but we reserved our table ahead of time in the beach front so that was alright... Staff was attentive and provided us a babysit for my little boy which was great.,3,March 2018
"Hotel is very accessible, just a few meters from the beach, got a beach front. food is a bit good, paid for a buffet dinner but was disappointed with their ""beef callos"" not really a callos (ox tripe). hotel service is very slow, have to call the FD several times for room cleaning. Massage service is exceptional. Got pools in every hotels, rooms are wide and comfortable. overall all experience could have been better if room service was addressed and food were heartily prepared. ",4,April 2018
"The trip to the hotel was quite nice because they have a pick up and transfer from the wharf to the hotel but when we arrive at the hotel, it was quite average, not like what we were expecting for the price that we paid the rooms had sand on the pillows, and the bathrooms weren't well cleaned. the breakfast buffet lacks variety and the pool wasn't very clean. the only thing that is good about this hotel was that it was close to the beach. I mean I could take all of those if only they weren't quite expensive. I wouldn't say that I got a good value for my money on this hotel.",3,May 2017
"If you are looking for a place with easy access to the beach and on a budget, it is a good place to stay!  It is a very short walk to the shore and is on station 2 which means that you can take a walk, by the beach, to stations 1 and 3 and the D'Mall where the main cluster of shops and food establishments are located.   Even though it is near the beach, it does not necessarily mean that you will get the view but they have 3 pools.   They have optional breakfast. The choices and quality are okay-ham slices with pineapple anyone?, but we found ourselves eating somewhere else after the first and second meals.  Bed and room ambiance were okay, generally clean but not pristine and service by the staff-cleaning team and reception was good.",3,September 2017
"Check in was very quick, just presented our voucher in a minute we're in our room. Our room is clean, bed is comfortable. The buffet breakfast was also good, the only minor issue we had was the unclear tv reception and no bath mat. Make sure you have P2,000.00 upon check-in for deposit.",4,March 2018
"The only merit I could give to this hotel is right in front of the beach. Check-in was pretty slow. We reached at 4pm plus and were told that 1 of our room was not ready! Isn't that the check in time is 2pm? All rooms should be ready by then. Hot water in the room was almost equal to none! Before I can apply shampoo to my hair, the hot water had ran out. They can even mix up the colour of the water tap on the basin. Poor WiFi in the whole hotel area. Limited choices for breakfast. An extreme old type Aircon. TV reception also bad. Everything in the room looks old and rusty. I doubt I would ever book this hotel. Realised that lots of other hotel along beach and looks more decent that this. The 1 star given for the sake of the location.",1,March 2018
"this hotel is a decent place to stay, you're only inside for 6 hours at most to sleep in this paradise, if you are a party goer chances are you dont even get to see your hotel,. Plus factor is this is far from the PRICEY central boracay, but still walkable, food is decent with edible breakfast spread. fuel up on breakfast buffet and just have a fancy dinner afterwards when you are at the central part of the island D'MALL, lots of selection",3,January 2018
"Okay, 1st of all I'm not even exaggerating on my title. I am familiar with Boracay's reputation as crowded. But oh my! This hotel have taken it to the next level. We were originally booked in an executive deluxe room but upon our arrival we're told that we have been moved to their new building, when I asked if it's the same value or if it's any better, receptionist responded that the room that we're going to get just doesn't have a bath tub. You be the judge if that's better for you or not. Her reason for moving us were quite unclear. When we got to our room, we tried to call for in-room dine-in but the number stick to their phones were incorrect, the safe is broken, we have no bath mat and no hand towels considering we have spent a good 30mins to 1hr in their reception being…",1,February 2018
"We booked here more than a month prior to our arrival, and suddenly the next day we had change of plans. It pisses me off that we are trying to contact them for possible ways that our money wont be wasted because we are fully aware that cancellation is not allowed. If only they are easy to contact and talk to, we called so many times and even called agoda, but both takes so long to answer. We dont have that enough time to call them every single time because we have our own lives and work to do. After hundreds of calls, agoda finally answered and we were advised to be emailed by La Carmela but the stress is still there because we feel like we are begging for them something well in fact, we are just trying to ask for some alternative ways and advices from them.

"Pros:  - GREAT location at station 2, only a few minutes walk to the beach and near to a 7-11  - The beach bar/pool area is a nice place to sit and the drinks and lunch menu are reasonably priced  - They provide a really good (paid for separately, but cheaper than some other options) door-to-door transfer service between the hotel and airport, loading and unloading your baggage for you the whole way (we had boards and big kite bags so it was a relief for them to take these on and off the boat for us!  - Efficient, albeit noisy, air con  - Fridge and safe provided in the room (although the safe codes are set and never change which doesn't feel too secure!)  - CHEAP  Cons:  -  Free Wifi didn't actually have any signal in our room and was generally unusable  - Breakfast.

"There were 3 of us, so it was nice to see 3 separate beds (double/queen).  The room is simple, the beds are comfortable and the buffet breakfast is adequate - not great, not bad.   The bathroom was clean, but the bidet hose sprayer needed some serious cleaning. Luckily, I had some alcohol wipes and cleaned it myself.   The lighting is too dim in the bathroom, and the room itself.  We had to turn on all the lamps to see adequately.  The a/c had to run all day, at maximum setting, to keep the room semi comfortable.  There is a device near the door to place the card to which is the room key is attached. This card turns on the electricity in the room.  When you leave the room and take the key, everything shuts off.  It took all night to make our room bearable.  The next day, we…",3,November 2017
"My wife and family decided to visit Boracay during the off season since my My mother had been there before. Her brother booked us a hotel here and we were excited to stay at a place so close to the beach. The check in process was far from personable besides them being on their phones, but I won't go into detail since that would be too long a review.     As soon as we finish unpacking we decide to go for a swim and enjoy the beaches and food. We come back a few hours later and I try and open my room to which the key had broke! My wife and I were surprised and went to the hotel desk to see what we could do. I showed them the key and the receptionist looked at me and said with fake distress ""oh no! charge!""

"Located in busy area at Station 2 Boracay. They have many buildings to cater huge number of bookings and reservations.  What is nice about this place: location buffet breakfast lots of staff to ask help for clean room and restroom good sleep free internet even inside the rooms  Personally, when i travel i prefer an accommodation of quality sleep and good accessibility. I don't like to stay in a luxury resort because you wont be staying there the whole time, unless you are. There's a lot to visit and try out day and night activities at Boracay. So i advise to allocate budget to entrance fees and good food.",4,August 2017
"If you look on my profile, you can see and notice that I have written a previous review of La Carmela De Boracay last year when I visited. This review is based on my second visit of January 2018.  Upon visiting the first time in 2017, the room was booked by my older brother. I didn't discuss or remember the price paid but the room was a basic room, although bright, vibrant, clean, and great. I thought for the price and being right on the beach, it was a great deal and hotel to stay at for my second visit to Boracay.  I planned this trip with a friend and booked online through agoda. The room cost was about $60 a night, normal for a reasonable Philippines hotel.  The hotel has two facilities. Now as I know one is older, and one is newer.  The room this time was dark, gloomy, and…",2,January 2018

Thanks La Carmela hotel and TravelOnline especially to Jyryx Nama for the hassle free trip and for the great package deal with awesome freebies. We have really enjoyed our vacation here in Boracay. I will definitely recommend you to our family and friends.,5,January 2018
This hotel is centrally located at Station 2. It is at the beach front. Simply convenience! There is no housekeeping. It is only upon request.  A row of ants spotted in the room from outside to the power point area. 2 dead spiders on the wall and 1 still hanging strong with its web. Daily Internet access log in required. Need to get new password from the reception counter everyday,4,January 2018
The hotel was ok. I liked that the restaurant and the pool was beach front. They alway do updates on rooms that have problems. They have lots of friendly staff to help out. The place was clean and safe. The buffet food was good and very reasonable price.  Few things I didnt like 1 of our room was located where close to the room where the staffroom is a lot of the staff gathers in the hallway and occationally very noisy even if we.are already sleeping. And another dissapointing thing I exp was when I went to swim in the pool I was wearing a bathing suit but because I had a massectomy on one of my breast I am very conciuose so I wear a sleeveless nylon cover for the top just to conceal a little bit of my chest nut I was asked to get out of the pool and remove that top as a lot of…,3,January 2018

"Positives - Superior rooms are decent. Good shuttle service to airport. Near nightlife / station 2. Negatives. On checking in you are given am A4 list of rules to read and sign. One of which is rooms are only cleaned if you request it!  It is 2000Php cash deposit - not mentioned at booking stage and inconvenient if you have just landed. Then, the elevators are broken, for 4 weeks. So with a bad back, we have to climb up and down 5 flights of stairs each time.  WiFi. You have to pay to get in room. 100Php and you wait whilst someone delivers the code to your room. Friends from another location turn up to see us. They are not allowed to come to room.

The reservation officer who received my reservation by the name of ""Judilyn"" failed to put us in the manifest hence no airport pickup arrived to fetch us. Luckily the local people in the airport helped us to locate the la carmela van who is dropping by some guest in the departure area. The driver was corteous and helpful but was using his phone during the entire trip which is really unsafe.  Arriving in La Carmela, it was very busy to the point that it makes you dizzy.

"Good location right on the beach but so many hotels in Boracay have that. It’s very big with mostly Korean and Filipino clients, this leads to the problem of breakfast which caters for Asian tastes and I struggled to find anything I could eat, the eggs were about all I liked, no bacon which was disappointing, the sausages were cut up hot dogs and there was stuff like noodles, stews etc which isn’t breakfast food for Western Europeans like me. The room was ok, didn’t have a balcony in our room which was a shame, the safety box was hard to open and had to enter number about 6 times every time to get it open which worried me. The shower wasn’t very good with low water pressure and not very warm water, there was no hose in the bathroom, no blow drier for my wife which was…",3,January 2018
"Boracay seems to always be busy - even at the end of December when the weather isn't so pleasant. But this hotel is well situated, not too far from the port and very close to the beach. Our Premier Super Delux room (East Wing) had 3 large double beds and a large balcony overlooking the pool area. The room was comfortable and clean. Buffet breakfast is very busy. Food is average, but its fine to start the day. The beach is like two different places by day and by night. Great buzz and a super place to visit.",4,December 2017
"Pros:  - great location on Station 2 of the White Beach.  Also, very close to 7-Eleven and a large convenience store.  - friendly staff - clean, basic room with ac - hot water heater provided - good value for money  Cons: - low water pressure - i had to ask the front desk for a hair dryer, they said they had to make sure one was available. Thankfully, one was available.  - no room cleaning or changing towels for entire duration of our stay (3 nights).  This is a great budget option, but if I'm going to Boracay again, I may spend a little more money for a nicer hotel. ",3,January 2018
"This is a budget hotel located at Station 2. It has its own beachfront with 10 beach beds and around five to six beach umbrellas. They have 5 buildings. We were billeted at the west wing because we got 2 super deluxe rooms which can comfortably sleep 8 people. We are six in the family so the rooms were big enough for us. Since it is a budget hotel, do not expect anything. They only provide 2 small soaps with a small bottle of shampoo and conditioner, thin towels, kettle, a pitcher, two cups and two glasses for the water. A water dispenser is available in every floor. It takes time for the water to be heated and water pressure is not that strong. Breakfast is ok..just enough to fill your tummy. They have good brewed coffee. You have to make a refundable deposit of P2,000 cash and…",3,December 2017
The room smelt like sewerage and there were insects scurrying across the floor the entire length of our stay. It's cheap but they tried to charge us 7000 pesos upon a 'check' of our room for use of the towels and stains on 4 of the bed linens even though there was only 2 in the room. After they did a 'double check' the price miraculously came down to 3000 pesos. So if you're keen to get charged for ghost stains and have the staff act negligent about the use of washing powder stay here and throw your money away.  Otherwise steer clear and do NOT support this scam of a hotel P.

"The hotel location is great. Employees are courteous and rooms are clean.  However, the elevator is always out of service. What also sucks is that you have to pay 100 per gadget for per day of WiFi use.  Also, also I would only give1 point for the breakfast for its bland taste.  The check out time is 11:00 am but it's a good thing that they have a baggage counter so you can still freely walk around the beach area while waiting for your departure time. Always book on-line, it's always cheaper. Overall, I can say that this hotel is overrated and is no longer as grand as before.",3,November 2017

This was literally the worst service I have ever received at any hotel anywhere not even within the Philippines, the staff were shocking and customer service did not seem to come into their vocabulary.  On top of this the room was dirty and breakfast was bland and undercooked.  The only thing it has going for it is it's beachfront location but to be honest you would be better off going to one of the smaller hostels, you'd save a lot of money, it'd probably be cleaner and the staff would have some courtesy, don't go here looking for luxury and…",1,April 2017

I like it coz its beach front. So no need for a long walk. I like the hotel amenities tho the foods are same same each day and the bathroom (shower) i think you need to have glass door/enclosure or curtain so the water will not flow to the CR. But overall we enjoyed our stay. Till next time. ,5,June 2017
"The place is quiet basic as the room you can imagine. Do not put too much or high hopes on their amenities. The breakfast way too common, for 270 pesos you can have all the basic Filipino breakfast choices in the buffet, there is a lot more choices around the beach front area. The room service is not that prompt. You can stay in the hotel, but not for too long for boredom will remind you for his presence. Recommended and ideal for individuals just want a basic place to sleep and rest but not for staying indoors for too long.

"For a beach front resort and a low price I think La Carmela de Boracay is an affordable luxury. Unlike most beach front resorts that are way more expensive, La Carmela is just very affordable. They have clean rooms, decent amenities and very attentive staff.   I say go for the deluxe rooms that are facing the beach. You’ll have a wonderful sunrise view if you do.

"I had already booked a room at this hotel before I read all the negative reviews about the hotel. When we arrived at the hotel a few days ago, we were really not expecting much.  How to get to the hotel: From the Cagban jetty port, we arranged to have a tricycle take us directly to the hotel. It cost 120Php (all in). If you'd like to save a few bucks, just tell the tricycle driver to drop you off at Station X. The hotel isn't that far from Station X; also, it would only cost 20Php per person. Travel time is probably around 10-15 minutes.  At the front desk: The hotel staff greeted us upon our arrival and attended to our every needs. We were given pineapple juice which we drank while we were at the front desk. Checking in was also easy. The receptionist explained all the hotel…",4,October 2017
"Hotel is in a great location. Rooms are quite basic but considering the price, excellent value for money.   Fridge. You need to turn on  Air Con. Ok. Could be colder  TV - Good quality tv. Standard channels.  Balcony. Very small. Mine overlooked the street entrance.  Breakfast. Ok. Not quite your English breakfast. Did have scrambled eggs. Sausages were more frankfurter.  All the staff were really polite and helpful.  Only gripe is the wi-fi 1. You have to pay for it  2. You have to add the code every time you connect  3. It would only connect on the bed nearest my door. If you’re on another bed you may have to move around to get signal. 4. Sometimes the WiFi speed was a little slow   You do need to put down a 2,000 PHP deposit (refundable so long as no damage) ",4,October 2017
"Very skeptic after reading most of the average views on here and questioned my family's decision of booking this hotel.  I was pleasantly surprised, greeted with a refreshing drink upon arrival (which was well needed) and had our luggage carried up for us.  Our rooms were clean, cool and comfortable which is all we really needed. Toiletries were provided as well as a few additional towels. We only simply had to ask for extra towels and toilet paper and it was bought to our room.  The check out process was easy and relatively quick.  A wi-fi card is available to purchase that allows you 24 hour access for 100pp and the connection was great.  If you are looking for a cheap hotel that is located a stones throw away from the White Beach and you just need a comfortable place to sleep…",4,September 2017

"It is situated just 2 mins from the beach. The rooms were big enough to accommodate 3 adults. The breakfast and staff were ok. Could improve the services.  They have two buildings,  dont remember the name/number of the building we were in, but it was the one that was far(2 mins). The other building was just at the beach. ",4,October 2016
This is probably the most go-to hotel in boracay.i like their services to think that its very affordable.plus the buffet breakfast was unexpectedly good too.you dont have to spend too much with a grandiose hotel.,4,August 2017
"Stayed in a 4 bed apartment from July 13-15. Beds were small and AC was like a heater. They had to change the AC unit at 2 in the morning because it was blowing warm air. We found out AC unit was frozen!! Mold in the small bathroom. There was a tub filled with dirty water with spider webs and mosquitoes outside the room in the balcony.  We were here back in 2008 and we thought they made changes/upgrade (according to their website). WRONG! Still old AC units, horrible food! I cant even eat half of their food. No quality. I gave them a second chance, and it will be the last one.",1,July 2017

"I love to stay in this hotel. Its clean. Near the beach and have free breakfast as well refillable drinking water. But there‘s now wifi in the hotel. I got the packages from local tour in manila that included airfare, land transport, jetty and hotels for 4 persons with affordable price. One thing to note when u stay in this hotel, dont ever stain their bedsheet. There will be charge of 2000pesos (around 39USD)  Staffs are friendly. ",5,September 2017

"My Family had a Wonderful weekend. This resort is only steps away to the famous white sand beach of Boracay, which makes it a highly recommended.   Reasonable price of there rooms which is nice and clean. Hotel staffs were friendly.  Special thanks to Miss Jeancy and friendly Front of the house staffs for welcoming and assisting us. To the pool staffs, keeping their eyes to the kids having fun swimming. To the courteous Housekeepers in the West wing and to Sir Gelito from security for helping us getting a ride. We will surely see you again soon.  ",4,August 2017

"This  Hotel is cheap for a beach front hotel. Compared to other beach front hotels, La Carmela De Boracay is way cheaper but cheap things come with a price. The room is smelly and linens and towels are not good and dirty. The breakfast buffet is Ordinary. Food is so so.",3,July 2017
"We were there during the Holy Week of April 2016. Sorry but the drop down to this app is not provided. We were disappointed for the sheets, linens needs to be soaked in chlorox! They're not white anymore. The place was jampacked by rowdy Koreans. I had a short altercation with a Korean national for they do not follow the line to the buffet table. If you're budget-conscious, this is the place for you. For me, it's my first and last visit. ",2,September 2016
Been here for a short vacation last summer in phils. Very near to restaurants and night life in boracay. People were good and friendly. Room service was superb! Ideally in station 3 and only few walks away from beach. ,4,April 2017

"We were so busy that it was a mistake on our part we did not do more research on this hotel. We based our decisions purely on online photos.  Upon chekin process, we knew we were is for a long ride 1. During registration, they went through a long list of what they will charge if ... 2. When we got our room, it was nothing like the pictures we saw.  It was very dark, gloomy, small and uninviting 3. Though we paid for 5 people, they only provide breakfast for two 4. Our first night, we could not sleep due to AC unit condensation from above floor was hitting our AC unit which created a loud thumping noise.

We got a standard room,  don't have any problems there except that the TV remote control was not working & yeah there's cockroach in the room, though I've only seen it once during our 3N4D stay. I think it would be great if they have a clothes rack for our wet swimsuit but we've done fine with the balcony.",3,August 2017
"We were there for 3D/2N and since we were there for such a short period of time, we were mostly on the beach and exploring Boracay. The service could be improved, but overall we had an OK stay. The room was clean. We barely use the pool. What I like most about this is the location - it's in the middle of Boracay so it's close to a lot of restaurants and store.",3,September 2016

"First i booked in this hotel because i already heard about the name...but when i approach the front desk in checking in...they seems to be busy and so stressed ...and its a No No in a hospitality industry which you are facing guest / tourist with different nationality and its not a good image of the Filipinos who should be accommodating and friendly but they are the other way around...here are some of the flaws on this hotel aside from the staff...  1. You need to deposit 2k  2. Old amenities... 3. Small room and no maintenance 4. DIRTY PILLOW 5. Old AC and its not working well... 6. Room smells bad...  But one thing i can say good thing on this hotel is its accessible to the beach and they have a small pool with jacuzzi..  In general, definitely i will not return to this hotel…",3,July 2017
"I would never go back to this hotel.  It was horrible.  No towels unless you go and get them yourself, no TP unless you go and get it from the front desk.  You have to ask for everything.  The breakfast is the same every morning and is so over crowed.  food was cold and tasteless.  I would recommend you look for a better place to stay.",1,January 2017
"We traveled with about 30 people and rented 7 rooms.  The original rooms we booked were the standard rooms and upon entering the room, I wanted to run out screaming.  Although the place was roomy, it was very dark and dank.  The room was lit with what seemed like 3 -  30watt bulbs.  The only natural light came from a 2ftx3ft window that over looked a construction site & shacks.  The hallway to get to the front door was very dark and busy.  Other rooms were propped open and you could see 10 people just sprawled all over the place.  The bathroom was disgusting & the toilet wouldn't even flush.  The walkway to get from the building to the beach smelt like rotten fish with unknown liquids dripping from the roof top.  I had our room upgraded to the VIP rooms which were steps away…",2,June 2017

Hotel situated on Station 2 near restaurants, mini markets and the Regency Casino with every night karaoke. Pharmacy near by for that unexpected cure for to much sun tanning. Staff pleasant and helpful. Beach towels available for rent at PHP 50 per towel.

The bathroom is in bad shape and in dire need of makeover.   The door is too close to the commode making it impossible to open and close the door without the bottom of the door dragging the floor matt.  The shower does not have a door or curtain.

"La Carmela de Boracay is one big hotel right on the beachfront of Boracay. Surprisingly, the hotels offer great price for the travelers.  While this is a huge hotel, you will also be surprised by the kind of service that they offer. They are not as customer friendly as expected, most of their staff are trainees (which lack the training of course). But since I travel on a budget most of the time, I will still go back to this hotel because of the great price that they offer.",4,May 2017

The room is small but it's fine, but cleanliness is another issue, every time  we open the room, the smell, ugh! Aircon is not cooling much, i asked for e-fan just to comfort the kids even, but according to the operator, it is not allowed. She sent us a maintenance to check but all he did is clean the filter so we ended up a warm night. Buffet breakfast has few choices only and not much inviting to eat so we ended up dining outside.

Bed linen was not changed as I can feel there were sand on it.  We had to ask for a change of room.  They showed us another room and it was not any better so they asked us to wait the next day.    Buffet breakfast place was chaotic.  Crowded and seats were limited.  Someone reserves two long tables and that's it, nowhere else to seat.  Suggest to go somewhere else for breakfast.  Food was also not good.  So had only plain bread.  Overall, suggest to stay elsewhere.",2,June 2017

The renovations and hotel expansion seem complete and the hotel is better than before. It's not 5 star luxury but a great choice for beach lovers and families. There are now 3 pools and the beautiful Boracay white sands and turquoise beach are just a couple of metres from the front of the hotel, which is conveniently situated in Station 2, the middle of everything. The rooms are clean, comfortable and quiet. The complimentary cold drink on arrival is still appreciated.

Traveled with my dad and sisters to visit the world-renowned beach island. This is a budget hotel so don't expect a lot of upgrades you see in modern hotels.

We don't  have a mirror in the room except for one in the bathroom. We were on the ground floor and a bit near their restaurant as well as the beach, so it's easy to come back and forth.  However, I find the alley relatively small and dark which I think should be lighted.  The food they offered was  just okay but we were really craving for fresh fruits which was not available for the duration of our stay. There are two swimming pools which are good for kids.

"The Hotel is relatively cheap compared to other beach front hotels, although it's a little bit far from the quite part of the beach in station 1, but that's fine because there are a lot of shops, clubs and restaurants next to the hotel if you are a night owl. There was also no wifi connection in our room when we stayed so I guess that's the only downside of our stay.   We love the island we had so much fun in the beach and the concierge/front desk helped us in booking a lit of our activities.   We'll definitely comeback!",5,March 2017

I wonder if how long the room has been vacant to have that kind of dirty toilet bowl. We called the housekeeping to clean it but they didn't arrive soon. We just flushed and flushed the bowl until it became good as clean. I called the front office and told them the situation and they asked us if what do we want them to do! Geeez!

They accompany us to the clinic at station 1. All is good but when I asked the clinic if La Carmela will pay for the consultation fee. Arrogant receptionist at the clinic answered me, Ikaw and magbabayad nyan! So I complained at La Carmela, ended up they refund consultation fee, transpo back to hotel and bought the prescribed medicine. They moved us to other room at 2nd floor.

Cheers!",3,April 2017
I would never recommend this hotel it's old and unclean. The rooms are dingy and the towels are dirty!!! Staff were unhelpful and needed to push to get help ie directions or a tricycle.

"I expected a lot from the La Carmela de boracay because it is well endorsed by Boy Abunda in his show, but when me & my friends checked in, the front desk upgraded our room which is a good thing but, the airconditioner was like a fan. It was so hot especially when we checked in yesterday. We reported it but they acted late. The maintenance just cleaned the filter and said we should wait for about 30 minutes and if it doesn't work, then we should call again if it needs to be replaced. We waited for hours and eventually they replaced it. It was still not cool in our room after they replaced it. 😡 Then, the breakfast buffet was also bad! So frustrating! The food was so bland as well the drinks. It was so bad that we didn't go back to refill our plates.",2,May 2017

The staff were very accommodating and they will greet you nicely.................There were a lot of options to choose from the buffet breakfast.

Our stay at this hotel would have been fine had it not been for seeing cockroaches within the first few minutes of walking into the bathroom. The first impression is always a lasting impression and seeing these things crawling around is definitely not a good look for your hotel. Apart from that though everything else was as expectedly standard. Staff were polite and attended to requests promptly. Food was okay but seeing a lot of the staff just standing around eyeing guests while they ate also doesn't give one a sense of comfort. If the cockroach situation can just be taken care of then it wouldn't have been so bad. Things could be worse I suppose...,2,May 2017
"Nothing special. This hotel has everything that you need. I believe it is the best hotel for the budget-conscious and its location is great. Not that far from the party scene from the recently concluded LaBoracay, yet far enough not to hear the loud music if you opted to just rest instead of partying.   There are a lot of improvements that need to be done in this hotel, but all in all it delivers. The buffet breakfast is great too.",3,May 2017

Started out bad got to the room after checking in and being told we would have to request and stay in the room for cleaning or sign a paper just so they would clean after requesting it. Then getting into the lackluster room getting sand all over my feet from poor cleaning. There were ants in the bathroom too. Trying to take a shower was ridiculous. The hot water took forever and was barely more then dripping from the shower with frequent stops in water flow. Making it almost impossible to have a regular full shower and early in the morning the water was barely luke warm. The staff could care less.

"Well not even sure where to start, they do things very different, maybe because they have over 800 rooms, but I didnt like it. First thing is if you want your room cleaned you must let the front desk know and they will let housekeeping know. It never got cleaned in a timely manner and ONE time we signed up to get cleaned at 830AM and when we returned at 6PM it still was not cleaned and when I complained it still took 2 more hours. There was no hot water as the hot water heater didn't work and maybe because there was not much water pressure, called maintenance four times as they also fixed it four times and still did not work after a seven day stay. Also they could not fix or  toilet seat as one side was not locked down. The AC did not work great. Rooms really need some…",2,April 2017
The first time I stayed at la carmela was probably 10 years ago....the old la carmela. our first day then I checked out and went to station 1 instead. I didn't like their water here it had sewer smell. and just felt dirty then.  2nd time is a charm..Came here for Christmas vacation and my in laws arranged everything but I was worried at first since my last experience with them. But I was surprised to see the improvement of this hotel...they did a fantastic job remodeling it. and yes the first thing I checked was the faucet water.  everything is good although they don't provide you wtih rugs for the bathroom I had to ask. And another thing I noticed...they didn't throw away the used bathroom amenities...I had to call the front desk to replace them...which I find sort of…,4,December 2016

"..THANKS for arranging our Boracay Get-Away TravelOnline. ..For a Superb-Customer Service from a ""madaliang-inquiries"" to ""madaliang-booking"" upon visiting your office. Thank you for an excellent service up to our arrival & stay esp. in La Carmela de Boracay. Though we didn't got a chance to avail a low-cost promo package because it's already peak-season & nalipasan na daw kami ng mga PROMOs dhil it's already SUMMER na when we booked but still, everything was efficient & stress free. Big Thanks Travelonline, La Carmela De Boracay & Ms. Marife Delos Santos. Kudos. 👌",5,March 2017
Room not too spacious and air condition not so cold. Complimentary food not so delicious. Staffs are accommodating ang greet you.can be recommended but we did stay more in the place because we are enjoying outdoor activities. If you have small budget this is better. ,3,March 2017
"Big mistake!    Pro: close to beach & big room with four beds.   Con: check into the room, the floor was so  so dirty that my foot is in black colour! Requested them to mop the floor.  Toilet is small and old.   Room is not well maintain. All look so run down  Small swimming pool although they have three.  Front desk service is bad. I had stayed in other hotels before I change to this hotel and I can compare.  Breakfast is OK. But nothing to shout about..   Free WiFi only available at the new wing!  ",1,March 2017

"Disappointing stay: over all size of room was ok, bed was full sized not queen, beddings could be helped, not very comfortable, Inadequate lighting in the bathroom nor room itself, water in the shower was weak- our first room was worse and stinky, but got easily transferred upon request. Had to request for hand towel but response was quick enouh. Breakfast buffet was nothing impressive, but small refrigerator in the room proved useful for leftovers and cooling drinks. Great location too! Staff members especially at reception need to learn how to be more pleasant, and especially one particular guard...he needs to be more friendly to guests.",3,March 2017
"Our first few hours we found the tap water smelt disgusting, the toilet broke, you had to pay for wifi.  Then of the five guests, only 3 received breakfast. The room when we returned at 4pm next day was not cleaned.   This room is very old and deteriorated. The worst feature is how much we paid for three beds.  I moved into my own place for the same price at a different hotel that was a lot better.   Reconsider this one",2,March 2017
"i love the area, very near in everything we need. the staff are helpful, you can walk every place you want to go beside the beach not outside ok, we experieced taking a tricyle paid 75 pesos later on we found out we can walk in beside the beach and everything we need are all over the area that we stayed i loved it:)",5,March 2017
"I am afraid of the review. There is a lot of negative comment...  We stayed for 3 nyts and 4 days. Unlimitted hot and cold water to drink. You can eat buffet breakfast at Jade Hall or in front of the beach. Good Food but the menu is with repetition. Its your choice how to vary the menu to make enjoyable and taste good. You can request change of the towels, shampoo and soap at the lobby. You can call 100. There is hot and cold water for shower...   No FREE WIFI... Pay 100 pesos per gadget for 24hrs use of WIFI...  I enjoy! Very accessible to affordable food, island hopping, market, buffet dinner, spa and a lot more that you need...  ",4,March 2017
Stayed here for 3 nights with my family. We booked an executive deluxe room. The staff are very helpful & friendly. Even helped me get a cake on the day of my husband's birthday. The room is clean & breakfast buffet is yummy. We were given a free dinner buffet as well for 1 night. They have 3 pools & my kid loved it. Great access to the beach & restaurants. We tried their room service massage. The price is just right & it was so relaxing.,5,February 2017
"We've booked here for the second time because our experience in La Carmela before was ok. But our second stay in executive deluxe was not quite okay because first, I saw a tiny wound in my finger and thought it was bitten by a mouse (I was bitten by a mouse before so i know what it looks like). Second is my 1 yr old daughter got 2 insect/cockroach bite on her face and until now it's still there. So yeah that's our experience.",3,March 2017

"My travel in Boracay and used this hotel as a base last 2008, not April 2016 as I cannot push through without selecting for one.   Rooms are big but showers are hit or miss. Shower in out room was working but for the other colleagues was not.  They used to have buffet meals for breakfast, lunch and dinner. One dinner the candle was put near the food. As I was getting food, I accidentally pushed the glass of candle which was not supposed to be there only for the gas or liquefied wax to spill over my hand down to the sand. The food hotel staffs actually saw that and my other colleagues and suggested to me to file a complaint but nothing happened to my hand so I let it passed. However, what irked me was the stoic reaction of the staffs who were there and did nothing.  They just do…",2,April 2016
Room is ugly and the worst is always no water (always calling the FD since my sister is taking a shower but what makes me really angry was they told me that there is a problem but without even informing the guests in advance). Quality of buffet breakfast is not good. Did not enjoy my few days stay in this hotel and will not come back AGAIN.,1,February 2017
"Traveled together with my in-laws and found Boracay a real treasure to the Philippines. Back to the hotel review (sorry, amazed on the place), Room was just fine (A/C, towels, shower heater), packed with Free Buffet Breakfast, and with own swimming pool (good for kids that can't swim on beach). Travel agency tie-ups are the advantage (hassle-free arrangements) as the air, land, sea fares can be included on the package.",3,February 2017
"I've been here last year. this is one of the affordable but with a clean and nice place in boracay. this is a beach front hotel and they have amazing fire dance show every night. but if you're gonna stay here, you should request for a room near the dinning hall because the internet is placed only in the dinning hall. our room was far away from the dinning area that's why we have to go outside to connect to the internet. that's the only problem I've encountered in la carmela.",4,May 2016

Hotel is accesible to restaurant. Buffet breakfast is Ok.   Only bad thing is you need to pay for a wifi where most hotel nowadays offering free wifi when you stay.  No signal from our room which we need to go out when calling and sending messages.  Pool is not clean.  Affordable rooms.,3,August 2016

The location is beachfront and near convenience store so its pretty accessible. However here are the things that I find a bit of a downer.  1. The buffet breakfast is really not appetizing. I settle for the bread and strawberry jam because the quality of the food available is really not good.   2. There is no signal in our room. We have to go out of the balcony to be able to send a message.   3. You have to pay 100 pesos per device for a 24 hrs wifi connection.   4. The pool is not clean. Haven't seen anyone clean it during our stay.   5. The towels are not replaced daily and no daily cleaning service being done. You have to call if you need it to have your towels replaced.   6. Do not use the electricity outlet near the lamp. It is not safe for mobile devices. My phone battery…,2,February 2017
"There are a lot of hotels in Boracay, and La Carmela is one of the most popular. They partnered with a lot of Travel Agencies and they offer very affordable accommodations with free breakfast buffet. It's great that they are in front of the Station 2 Beach. I recommend this resort for budget-conscious travelers.",4,March 2016
"We've booked at La Carmela for 4d3n. Tips: if you're on MNL - Caticlan flight, don't pay for airline provided transfers, LCDB has their own transfer which is 325php inclusive of van and jetty fare plus the terminal fee.  Food: tried the free breakfast for 2 days, and they always serve same food. Which o okay. Accessibility: 3 mins walk to the beach and stores/restau of station 2 and 3.  Downtime: scarcity of smiking areas lol",4,February 2017
"Has all the basic ameneties and facilities. So you can survive a stay here. BUT everything is dingy, old and neglected and there are strange policies.   My shower head fell of the wall...the toilet seat was for a bigger bowl...and our air conditioner was just slipped into the hole and you could see inch wide gaps around it. There's a strange policy of no room cleaning and towel replacements UNTIL you ask for it. Hallways are dark, elacators are dirty and high traffic areas have floor mtas with holes. The list gies on and on.  To be fair, this review is for the older the La Carmela De Boracay Resort and Hotel...I believe the annex Hotel and Convention Center is newer and better but almost twice the price. But maintenance doesn't seem to be their strong suit so expect rapid…",3,February 2017
"Initially had a room that barely had a window and then thankfully decided to upgrade to a room facing the pool/beach with a balcony, which was well worth it. Service at the front desk/reception was great. Hotel grounds were kept clean at all times. Breakfast had a good selection but tended to be very crowded with some difficulty finding a table. Wifi is not free, and was very spotty and weak. Shower drained very slowly. Room service was quick and the food was delicious. All in all a very pleasant stay! ",4,January 2017
"Location - great!  beachfront with one of the dining rooms and larger pool area facing the beach. Very convenient - police station, 7Eleven and restaurants are close by.  Hotel amenities - 3 pools that I saw - used the larger one by the beach and it was a good size.  Breakfast was great - lots of selection and ample supply.  Bottled water available in multiple locations.  Room - we had three rooms - two smaller rooms w connecting door and one larger room at the end of the hall. Two smaller rooms were adequate size and worked fine. Third larger room stunk - thought it was just the musty smell from the beach / kids but nope. I think it was the plumbing. Rooms need updating - cracking tiles, mirrors, etc.  Overall - hotel is adequate (lots of upgrades apparently over the years) but…",3,February 2017

"Our institution were able to stay in La Carmela de Boracay sometime in summer. It was a fun-filled vacation since we enjoyed various activities including my favorite, island hopping, banana boating, and shopping.  La Carmela is not just near the shore but it also has its own swimming pool good for people who just wanted to relax and enjoy the water while eating and drinking. Hence, they have quality service and very clean accommodation.   I would always look forward to bringing my children in Boracay and stay at La Carmela de Boracay.",5,April 2016
"La Carmela is right in front of the beach. It sits on the demarcation line between Stations 2 and 3. You can have dinner by the sea as well as watch an amazing nightly poolside performance.   The food selection from the buffet area is better than most hotels because it has a lot of protein and not the usual carbohydrate laden meals in some establishments.   The staff are super courteous and the service is amazing.  My family always stays at this hotel complex, which offers a wide range of choices from the budget conscious to people with more discriminating taste.   A high-end hotel is in the works, so those for those who want the best accommodations, you might want to wait for a bit before visiting.   But then, who wants to stay indoors in Boracay?

"... needs a bit more sprucing up.  The pillows were the size of throw pillows. Towels looked really soiled up. My dad accidentally walked into me taking a shower because the bathroom door, which I thought I locked, apparently had to be slammed up into the door latch. The main doors of the standard rooms we got always slam into the corners of your bed, so you'd have to slither out of the room sideways most of the time. There was no toothpaste (even seedy motels from where I come from that charge you a latte's worth for 3 hours give you the great pleasure of having the means to brush your teeth). And the buffet was the exact same bland thing that it was during the first time I stayed here 2 years back when we got stranded by a storm and had no choice but to move to relatively…",3,February 2017

Staff accomodated all our requests. Fast hk services especially when you request for room cleaning as they have trainees around. Buffet breakfast is good since we had good selections during our 4 day stay.  Every night, they have a fire dancers perfoming at the pool area.   Remember that this is one of the budget hotels you will find in Boracay with a pool which was well enjoyed by my kids. If you need some fancy room with nice amenities, better check other accomodation or you will be disappointed otherwise.    Overall, we had a good experience hence La Carmela will still be on my list next time.   ",4,December 2016

There are a lot more resorts/hotels way better than this place but I'm telling you, you have to shell off more in terms of room rates. Their buffet breakfast is included most of the time on their room packages. You can wake up late bec they serve breakfast until 10am.

This place was massive, in personal and the staff were very unhelpful and not very friendly. All 3 complexes were overrun with Korean and Chinese families which meant that there was unsupervised children running around screaming all day and night.    We asked to change rooms after the maintenance came 3 times and still could not fix it properly.

We happened to have a room on the first floor, one of the closest to the front desk, which made for a very loud hallway.

It is very central, some parts open directly onto White Beach, and those that don't are very short stroll to it..  It is clean, and tidy,. but u dont get room made up unless you ask for it... Which I found rather good, as if I wanted to sleep in, then no one was going to bother you unless your wanted it.  The room was a great size. When our Aircon broke down, it was very promptly attended to.   I like the room we had, small balcony overlooking the sea, but not the beach as such, but it meant great views of fire works and great sunsets..

We've got this family room panorama- i can say that it is ok for the money we have paid. The hotel is close to the Beach. Wifi is good in the cafeteria (cafe la carmela) and free boracaywifi is also ok, though it is best at night- not so many are using it. If I will give a tip for the hotel- i think you need to improve your breakfast buffet and dinner buffet. The choices or variation of food is ok but the preparation and the taste is not so good. Most of the tourists really want to taste good filipino food.",4,January 2017

We were so wanting of an ocean view so we opted to look around for another hotel. It was peak season then so it was very difficult to find rooms available in the nice, beachfront hotels there until we came across La Carmela de Boracay.

A month before our flight I read quite a number of reviews, mixture of bad and good experiences, and all I can do is pray that what we receive from La Carmela would be quite an acceptable experience and they actually delivered even more.   We booked for 3 nights through TravelBook. I had to call them directly to confirm as it was the first time I booked through the site. They were accommodating and corteous.

We had the Premiere Deluxe room at the West Wing which appeared to be a bit old. Linens and towels appear to be worn out and bathroom supplies were not replenished daily. Floor on the comfort room gets flooded after taking a bath since the bathroom does not have a separate door. Water heater works just fine but would have loved warmer water.

"If you don't mind an average room with a sub-par buffet breakfast, then La Carmela is good enough for its price. For a 4-day 3-night stay, my wife and myself paid only slightly about Php 9,000.00. The location is close to the beach and all other businesses in the area (bars, restaurants, convenience stores, ATMs, souvenir shops). But it isn't ideal if you're more into the isolated-type of a resort as it could get crowded around the afternoon and evening (and I heard it's worse during peak season). Most of the staff are courteous and pleasant (I only encountered one snobbish staff at the restaurant). Overall, the value is good enough for its price.",4,January 2017

It is by or behind Whitesand beach and I will say that the best part of the hotel is just the location.  It is a huge hotel with a large number of rooms, and it split up to 3 sections.    My friends and I were very disappointed. The rooms are just ok, and dated due to the all use and wear and tear.  I guess you pay for what you get. It was not very expensive, I paid like 4000 php on Agoda.   I upgraded to a room with an ocean view and pool view.  I had to pay almost for the upgrade as much as the room.

The room was clean but the water pressure in the bathroom was very low. It was just a bit stronger than dripping water.   The facility was clean despite the majority of people being wet and sandy.  The breakfast buffet was very limited and some of the food was cold. They have two areas that you can eat and both have similar menus. But for the price we were paying, I wasn't expecting a grand meal.  The location is excellent. The tricycle can go directly from the port to the hotel.

La Carmela's staff are not generally courteous and friendly. It took awhile to get assistance at the front desk.",1,December 2016
The towels were dirty.  There were small cockroaches crawling.  The staff were noisy.  We can't sleep soundly at night because they talk loudly when passing through the hallway. There was someone who rang our doorbell at 12 midnight and found no one there.  Someone must have pranked us.  Location is good.,2,December 2016

No! if you want a hotel with free wifi...this is not the right hotel for you....if you want a hotel with an exotic pool where you can relax...this hotel is not for you!!  But, if you want a hotel where you can just sleep and take a shower - since you will be out the whole day exploring the rest Boracay - this is the right hotel for you....Its not expensive, hotel staff are nice and it's located in the center of Boracay...if you just want to something in your stomach that would last you until lunch or until you find an good restaurant or you prefer quantity over quality - then this is the hotel for you!

"If you want a pleasant vacation, try other hotels. This hotel is offering a lot cheaper accommodation but amenities are way below the standards. There is only one positive thing about this hotel - location. Water supply to our rooms had always been a problem. If you want to have your room cleaned, you need to go down to the front desk to request for it and sign the logbook. Towels are so dirty! Breakfast buffet is better than nothing. Hallways are always noisy. Hotel staff who are supposed to observe silence are even those causing the noise! When we were checking out, we were told that the toilet cover was damaged and we have to pay P400. This was our most terrible experience. We did not know how it happened!

"I booked our stay in la Carmela, the first room they gave us was like an attic, the air condition was not working, and its too hot because its an attic, my first day was ruined because i had a headache because of the room, i talk to the front desk and was delighted they move me to another room and it was very good. Thank you so much la Carmela for accommodating our needs. ",4,October 2016
"VERY ACCOMMODATING  Regards to the other reviews, I thought La Carmela De Boracay was a perfect stay. The hotel was average so don't expect a five star resort, however for $50 usd a night, the hotel was very clean daily and nightly and had superb guest services. It's located on Station 2 so it was very close to all amenities and a three minute walk to the beach. Breakfast buffet is offered if it's included in your room package.  House keeping was beyond superb making sure that all your needs were always met. When I accidentally forgot something in my room, I entered to find three housekeepers only scrubbing down every inch of the room to ensure that you were comfortable. The front desk staff were also always helpful and informative with only smiles.  The only negative I have to…",4,November 2016
"From its popularity and advertisements on television, I expected too much from this establishment. What I observe during our stay is the room is too dark, even the hallways are a bit creepy. There are lot of mosquitoes too. The room smells old. The water on the bathroom took so long before it gets hot. But overall, I enjoyed my stay.",3,December 2016
"The rooms are great, but it is too hot to stay at the veranda due to the heat coming from the aircons. The Wi-Fi was too expensive and was allowed to one gadget only. Other than that, our overall stay was okay and the food was great.",3,November 2016
"It is located in Station 2 of Boracay, which is really ideal because it is near the places where most people go out and have fun. The hotel is fine but not amazing. Some rooms are fairly near to the buildings which blocks the view of the beach because hotels there are very crowded to each other. The cellular signal is not the strong either, I had to go outside just to get a signal. You should probably get a reservation before arriving, in order for you to be able to be accommodated. All in all, the outside of the hotel is a narrow road, possibly one car can fit, but it's simple, and we also had a breakfast buffet which is free. The food was also reasonable enough. Hope this helps ",4,May 2016
"Staff was very accommodating, location wise was good, just fort of the beach on station 2, But the breakfast and rooms, no free wifi on your rooms, its not worth the price that they gave at that time.",3,November 2016
"Had a great stay. Thank you, very clean and accommodating staffs. We we're actually on a tight budget so we stayed here but no regrets because we enjoyed boracay. We love going to the beaches and my stay here, in palawan and alaminos city would be my top 3 favorites!",4,September 2016
"We had reservations, arrived super late at the hotel but was still accommodated. They gave us a choice if we wanted to be bumped of to a ""bigger room"" but was at the old wing or a smaller one in the new wing. We opted to stay at the bigger room on the old wing of the hotel. We thought that the whole hotel was beachfront but apparently, only the new one is; we had to walk for about a minute or two before getting to the beach.  Corridors had a high ceiling but with very poor lighting, makes it look old. Rooms on this wing were also also kind of old; even the sheets and pillows looked old. They had an okay bathroom. This made us stay outside of the room most of the time which somehow was a good thing, we got to enjoy boracay. Staff and crew were really accommodating and nice.",3,October 2016
"We had an overnight stay at the new wing. it was a nice hotel specially if your on a budget or with a large family or group of friends. Its a walking distance to the beach, d mall and to restaurants. Room is clean, they even provide ammenities like shampoo and soap and cleaning your room is upon request. The staff were nice and accomodating. Its a practical hotel to stay at since most of the time your out of your room.",4,November 2016
"If it wasn't for the urgency to look for an accommodation, we won't be bothering checking in this hotel. I guess a 2 star rating is already generous for this review.   Room - No cabinets. Poor lighting and air conditioning. Old bedsheets and pillowcases. If you want to stay in a run down room then check in here.  Bathroom - Barely no water coming from the sink. No water to flush the toilet. At least there's a little water from the shower.  Food - Really doesn't taste good. Don't tell me I didn't warn you.   Staff - Probably the only positive thing I could say on this review.   What's my reference on this? We stayed on another closed by boutique hotel. That was a lot better and have bigger rooms with half the price. Sadly, we weren't able to extend our stay there due to their…",2,November 2016
"Very crowded for breakfast. But there are variety of places around the hotel, therefore it is not a big deal. I would still recommend La Carmela de Boracay to others specially who have limited budget.",3,November 2016
This was my second time in Boracay and the experience was still the same. Station 2 is the busy part of the island with the hustle and bustle of tour guides waiting outside your hotel. This hotel had four different building all in the same location but spread out. What I loved about it was it was accessible to the front of the beach and had its own sunbeds. Very friendly staff and very accommodating. Pleasant stay.,4,November 2016
Worth it for its price specially for group of friends.  Staff attended to us well. No complaints there.  Didn't try the pool but looks clean.  The room we booked was good for 6. Space is just right. Not too small not too big. Bed is comfortable. Everything working.  Breakfast buffet is good with average selection. It gets crowded though.    Overall nice experience.  ,4,November 2016
I stayed here in November and really enjoyed my stay. It is very close to the Beach and the main strip. The room was clean. The only disappointing thing was you have to pay for WIFI and it wouldn't work for me. The Breakfast buffet was huge and alot of assortment to choose from. The Staff are all friendly and always had smiles on there faces. I would certainly stay here again if i was in Boracay. Thank-you,4,November 2016
"Firstly thank for upgraded my room to executive room.  Staffs were friendly and provided us the necessary information we all need regarding our stay.

"I was very hesitant to book this hotel due to the high amount of negative comments I've read, so my family and I waited to get in the vicinity so we can check the rooms first before booking it.  This hotel is pretty big and the employees are courteous. The location is conveniently located in front of the beach where you would just literally go down the stairs from your room, walk pass the breakfast area, the swimming pool and wah la the beach is already there. There are a bunch of restaurants walking distance as well, convenient stores and souvenir shops. Aside from the location, this hotel does not cost so much. We stayed for 3 nights, got 2 rooms and I believe they have free breakfast as well 2 per room. We are 9 so 5 of us paid out of pocket for the breakfast, it was not best…",4,November 2016
"Stayed at La Carmela de Boracay, booked thru Agoda so we were able to get pretty cheap rates.  We were given a room in one of the new wings. It was very roomy, but the water kept leaking to the room whenever we took a shower. A/C wasn't very cold too especially for the summer heat. However, they had 24/7 cleaning service so we had them mop up the room every night.  Breakfast buffet was included for the rate. Sufficient, but no bacon!  If you're primarily going to be in station 2 and 3, this is a great hotel to stay in. But if you'll be going to station 1, this is a little far, as this is right smack in the border of stations 2 and 3.  This is my second time to stay in La Carmela, and I consider it bang for the buck. We only used it for sleeping and bathing anyway.",4,April 2016
"Location is very good, close to the beach front with lots of restaurants and street vendors. The breakfast buffet was ok but takes long time to replenish items and food is cold. Room was ok but needs a few improvements. Overall is ok. PROS: Room is clean. Beds are ok. Small balcony and nice pool. Staff is ok. check in and check out is good. Transportation arrangements from the hotel back to airport was good.  CONS: Only one towel, no face or hand towel. Water pressure is very low, barely enough to take shower. Lacks storage space. No microwave, no food delivery allowed other than the hotel room service (10% service charge). elevator broken for more than a month according to one of the staff. Must pay for room WIFI. In-room safe is very small, not good for laptops.",3,November 2016
Pros  Service was good. Buffet was good enough. Has pool for night swimming. Not that Pricey.  Cons Comfort Room needs more cleaning. The aircon in the other room seems not that cold. Only one keycard.    You cant charge while outside the room. Some towels are not that white anymore. (nitpicking here.)  It qualifies as a decent hotel if you are not that picky. Overall good but not perfect but still it is decent compared to some of the reviews here.  I dont really like the shower bath tub style but its a matter of personal preference.  If you are on a budget it is actually good enough.  Would i book again? Possibly if I am on a tight budget. But to be honest I only use rooms for sleeping and showering. Boracay is for the beach and the activities.  Overall its good enough.,4,November 2016
"We've been in Boracay last Sep. Together with my Friends in Dubai.   It's convinient to stay here, it's accessible to all.   We had a Breakfast buffet, the food is just typical nothing so special in our 3 days there. Hope they can have at least they change their food. We wanted to avail also the dinner but we tried the other restaurant.   It's budgetable to stay in Carmela and good with a couple of friends.  Only thing is, hope they can give a warm hospitality to their Guest.  ",3,September 2016
"A cheap choice to eat BBQ at beach (290P). Daily soup, 4 main courses, salads,  3 desserts and you can create your own noodle dish with different ingredients and let it be cooked and served.  For that price and goid food, no complaints.  Good and friendly service.",4,November 2016

The room smelled that it wasn't used for years, and upon checking-in, the floor was still sandy like it wasn't been swept at all.  The air-con is warm even in max power, and turned on for hours.  The shower has hot shower, but the water becomes very cold after a short while.  The faucet in the sink cam wet yourself if turned on max.  The sheets has small flying mosquitoes, which I don't know where they came from.  The breakfast buffet is ordinary, but some food are blant.

"Yes, as the saying goes, you get what you pay for. Location was very ideal, but the facilities can still improve, especially the rooms on one of the wings, where me and my family stayed.  CONS - Instead of a keycard, they use the traditional key, with the card attached to it to activate the electricity. - We were promised by the reception that we would get COMPLIMENTARY BOTTLED WATTER. Alas, we found out that they only give those to guests in the more expensive rooms. VERY VERY MISLEADING! - Hallways are very dim. - There were ONLY 2 SOCKETS in our room. One in the bathroom, and the other one near the door. - WIFI IS NOT FREE. You have to pay 100 PESOS for access that is only good for 24 HOURS.  PROS - Breakfast was okay. They always replenished the food. I just hope that next…",3,September 2016
"Went there during summer. it was really comfortable and affordable for my family to stay for at least 3 days. They accompany us well, we feel really special even if there are a lot of people staying. The food they serve are amazing. It was really nice and comfortable.",5,April 2016
"La Carmela has an old type of accommodation that uses the traditional key for the door and not the keycard type. The room that we stayed in also does not have a cabinet as you'd exect. The staff are kind and accommodating which made the stay worth it. However they are not responsive when it comes to online and landline inquiry. Nobody's responding. Not even their FB page. When my friend messaged them a week before, they responded when we were already on our 2nd day in the hotel.",4,July 2016
"Nice hotel, the staff was so good to us, they even let us stay for a few more hours, i guess it wasn't that busy on that day, it's worth of your money! Beach front hotel are awesome! It's very near to the establishments in the area especially the D'mall! ",4,March 2016
"Nice Hotel, Friendly staff. Groceries,shops and restaurants are near. Free breakfast buffet is okay. Plenty of East Asian tourist though and they're sometimes noisy at the hallways at night when you want some much needed sleep.   I don't know why but in our last day just hours before we checked out we don't have running water in our bathroom.  Stayed there for three nights this Holy Week.",3,April 2016
"La Carmela is the cheapest beachfront hotel with a pool. The rooms are okay. But since we stayed here for a week, it's a bit inconvenience for asking them to clean your room since they won't clean it when you're not around. The pool have strong chlorine. The breakfast is not the best, but you could get what you pay. Staff are nice. If you're on budget then La Carmela is the best place to be...",5,September 2015

The hotel is a beach front and an easy access to the beach. Overall stay is good, you can request for everyday housekeeping...",4,August 2016
"Stayed here for two nights with my officemates. Staff are very welcoming. The location is very convenient. Booked thru agoda and we have not encountered any inconvenience from the start. The room price per night is just right given the fact that breakfast is free. Frontdesk services is open 24 hours as well as the restaurant. So if you ever get hungry in the early hours of the day, you need not to worry, just a call on the frontdesk. Breakfast is just okay, hey it's free! ",4,August 2016

"Stayed there for 4 weeks. Stayed here because it was all inclusive and had 3 pools. They always turn on their generator, which is not a real generator, as it just allows emergency lights, even where is no storm. Phone didn't work for 5 days, nothing fixed, water pressure in shower is the worst I have seen-drizzled hot water, shower often backed up flooding the floor, staff argued with me that I was not allowed to use my own electricity I paid for, ""No sir, you can't use continuous electricity"" when I wanted to get a tattoo in my room, even though there is a refrigerator, free wifi only works with mobiles, not my new laptop, almost everytime I asked for something, they failed miserably, buffet breakfast repeats every 3 or 4 days, food has lots of bones, they don't replace food…",2,July 2016
Very good choice for couples. They have also the lowest (the last time I checked) transfer rate. Only that during bfast some trays were left empty for a long time due to numerous guests. But I'll still recommend this for sure.,4,November 2015
"I'll start from our pick up from airport. Since we were a group of 8pax, we were picked up by an air conditioned van--that was a plus.  Then sumakay kami ng kanilang big bangka who could accommodate a big crowd. That was impressive.   When we got to boracay island,sinalubong kami ng tour guide and led to our van that would take us to La Carmela. Seeing our van, I was like ""Huh? Pwede na itong silaban sa kalumaan ha."" One foreigner who went with us was sweating really bad dahil hindi lumalamig ang aircon, we were sweating like pigs! Yes nasa pinas ka pero kung ang buga ng aircon ay apoy, thats a different story.

Friendly staff, they were able to help us during a medical emergency. However we waited for a while for check in  (I understand as it was peak season and we came a little early)",3,May 2016
"Which is a basic room to sleep in after spending all your cash on food and activities.   Cons: There's no water/coffee in the room, there's barely any toiletries, breakfast buffet is bland, the A/C's not that cold, and they DO NOT take credit cards!!! You have to pay for the WiFi if you want to use it in your room, too.   Pros: It is, however, a one-minute walk from the beach, near amazing food places and souvenir shops, bars, etc. The location is rly A+.  They also offer to hold your baggage after check-out if your flight is not until nighttime so you can still do activities. There's a common shower you can use near the lobby if you don't wanna extend your stay and pay by the hour for the room. Again, very basic but it gets the job done.   Verdict: Would I go back? Sure, cause…",3,May 2016
"Room is just a room, nothing special. Its a place just for sleep. Ac not cooling well and no set up of coffees. Well its just fine for us since we went to Boracay just to see the beach and not for staycation. They just serve ordinary filipino breakfast and very few choices. Pancakes are served cold and not soft. Receptionist are like robots, you  cant see any hospitality to what they do. Again, its just a so so hotel. You get what you paid for.",2,July 2016
"Thumbs up for the location since it's a beach-front hotel in Station 2 (right?) for a good price. That's the best part about this hotel.  Rooms were fairly okay. Simple. Clean. Although it didn't feel homey for me. Must be the rough bed sheets and thin bath towels. I appreciated the balcony for every room. The shower/heater worked perfectly fine (since I am very particular with comfort rooms). Water dispensers around the hotel were convenient for us, too.   The pool area is small, crowded and too open. They don't serve ala carte breakfasts until 11 am. They serve buffet.   We didn't have any meals in La Carmela. Didn't hang out anywhere in the hotel. I can't even say anything about the staff cause I only encountered them while checking -in/out.  I'd come back and book again…",3,July 2016
The hotel staff were friendly and accommodating.  We enjoyed the promo price for our room. Value for money. But the buffet breakfast did not suit my tastebuds since i don't like spicy food. Perhaps it was because most of the hotel guests were Koreans.,4,July 2016

"I've stayed in La Carmela twice before thus decided on a third stay which proved to be disappointing. Now that they have expanded, service is no longer personable. You, the guest, is a money-making entity! Let's start with check-in. Immediately, I was slapped with a Php 2,000 refundable deposit. That DID NOT exist before. They claim to have free wifi - but was told it only exists in the restaurant and main lobby.  We stayed 4 days and was never able to connect. A guest can avail of wifi in the room for P 100 (if i recall), good for 4 hours , i think, 1 gadget only. Aarrggh! 3 people in 1 room = 1 gadget?!! Go figure. Last but not least, ultimate check-out is at 12nn. The Receptionist claims she was calling me for a reminder prior to 12nn when actually she called at 12:45pm. By…",3,July 2016
"Crowded because the price is cheaper than other hotels. The pool also crowded. Breakfast buffet was fine but the same food everyday. The room we slept in was dirty (i saw a cockroach). THE BUILDING WAS COMPRESSED SO THAT PLENTY OF ROOMS WOULD FIT IN!! Very congested. Ourbalcony was facing a wall, it was hot inside the room and no air! To be fair, the staff were great.",2,April 2016
"The room size is big and its just less than 5 minutes walk to the beach. The staff are friendly and the breakfast is not that bad. For the rates they charge, its very reasonable. The only set-back I can think is the presence of mosquito in the grounds that find their way into the rooms. Other than that, I give this place a thumbs up!",4,April 2016
" Pictures posted on the website clearly truly represents the rooms they offer. Our room is in the main bldg and looks older than we expect. Food they serve is tasty, complete amenities and room rate is affordable.  I love the fact that the hotel is beachfront however, I hope they'll add lights at the hallway coz it's too dim.",3,July 2016

"The pictures shown about hotel room is simply  ""cosmetic"" photos. The reality shows much differences. Toilet amenities will not be replenished if not requested. Bath towels doesn't look hygienic at all. Not enough space in the lobby. WiFi is available in the lobby in just one of the buildings. You need to cross the other building to get WiFi. Neighbor room occupants too noisy at middle of the night.  The only good thing is that when you request for something, they respond immediately and hotel location is close to the sea.",2,July 2016

Unlimited hot and cold drinking water which was a great saving considering bottled water in boracay is soo expensive. Free breakfast was okay. Our room was near restaurant, pool and beach. Overall i will stay again in this hotel considering the price, location and service.   ",5,July 2016
Sorry have no pics but I enjoyed my time here only had few problems but I did not complain my list below.  Stained bed sheets and toilet smelled a little but besides all that I enjoyed my stay.  Would I try this hotel again?  (Yes)  I would try this hotel again staff was nice always and its cheap hotel so all good.  Close to the beach as well very handy. ,4,June 2016

"We stayed in La Carmela for 4 days and 3 nights last June. We booked their Panoramic Room which was good for 8 persons (although there were only 7 of us), and a loft-type of room. We booked it through boracay best deals for about 6k a night, which was not bad. It has standard amenities, cable, AC, tub with h/c showers, a mini fridge, and a balcony, plus complimentary breakfasts for 4. Additional breakfast tickets could be bought for about 270-280.00 per person. Food was decent, but I loved the cereals. La Carmela is convenient for it seems to be in the center of everything. Convenient stores and restaurants are just a few steps away. D'Talipapa was in close vicinity but D'Mall could be farther. It is also near the ""jump-off"" point of water activities in Boracay.

The only thing good about this hotel is its beachfront location. The rest sucks as my 16 year old son puts it! Our room had flimsy dirty white linens and pillow covers, flimsy towels. Room was smelly. Water from the shower flowed into the toilet area, making the floor wet and slippery. Invitation for a fall and subsequent fracture (God forbid). I informed the staff of my concern. They offered a different room which was as bad as  the first one but at least it was on the ground floor so we took it. On the second night, my daughter saw a cockroach crawling on the floor and she freaked…",2,July 2016
"Wonderful, friendly staff.  Awesome great location in Station 3.  Convenient location to the restaurants along the beach.  The hotel itself has average food - we had buffet breakfast, nothing spectacular about it, although I commend it for the variety. It serves a lot of Korean food as well (which is reasonable because they have a lot of Korean guests).   Neat rooms, but (very) old towels. The bed sheets are okay-ish. The staff clean the room and change the linens upon request.  We had a street-facing room with balcony and air-condition in the executive building, which I got for a very cheap price in lastminute.com. I guess the room is more than what I paid for. We weren't bothered by the noise in and out of the hotel, which is good, considering its the peak of summertime in the…",3,April 2016
Location is great as it is at station II. Transportation arrangement to airport and vice versa is well organised.  But the room just basic.   Strange thing the bathroom have funny smell. No free wifi.  Breakfast buffet just an average.  Staff service is just ok.,3,July 2016
"First of all, i don't know if it was due to the season we visited during, but there were a lot of families. Not that it is a problem, but I think for a young couple as us, it was just not a good fit.  The staff was very nice, however I recall waiting a while before our room was available.  The room was nice at first glance, but the air con kept spitting ice out - i don't know if this is normal, but it was strange!  On the sheet there was blood - I should have said something or left a comment at the reception, however I didn't. That is my fault. But the cleaning service should have noticed this.  The breakfast was ok, standard Filipino dishes.",3,August 2015

"Just your basic hotel. Wifi is only at the lobby, you need to pay if you want to avail wifi at your room (per hour). But who needs wifi, the data signal of Smart is great (and maybe Globe). Breakfast is buffet style, nothing special though. The location is in between station 2 and 3, so a bit walking is required if you want to go to D'Mall. They provide airport shuttle from and to Kalibo airport for 1K per head. Staff are nice and courteous. Overall, it wasn't a bad choice.",3,June 2016
"Most of the travelers who made their booking via travel agencies were affiliated in this hotel making it crowded and busy.    The staff are friendly even the trainees, the hotel is overall generally good for first time group travellers.  However, the following could have been further improved: - Check-in Waiting Time.  We've waiting for more than 30 minutes before we got checked in, since they need to have our IDs photocopied in the Main Executive Wing  - Towels Availability. Towels will only be delivered upon request, and not readily available in the room.

They required me to deposit 2000 pesos in the check in and they will not allow you to check in without voucher - for me this is not good in the hotels I have stayed around the world they didn't look for voucher just look to their system.

The hotel is very clean. You can see a lot of staff with the spray thing hooked on their back pocket and always spraying and moping the floors. There was a power interruption but immediately their generator was brought to life. Buffet for kids are free so it's a great thing. We got upgraded from standard to executive in the new building so there's that. ,5,June 2016

Although I have to say, housekeeping staff were very accommodating and responsive with our requests.  Breakfast was average. They offer around 3-4 viands, fried and plain rice, coffee, desserts (fruits, pastry), drinks, and cereals.  WiFi fee is too high (Php 100 per gadget per day).

Plus there's an annoying staff that offers us activies that is managed by an outsider friend of his (he even went inside our room--scary staff) but what really turned me down is the buffet breakfast, i saw small cockroach on the food( told the staff about the roach, he saw it also and brought the food inside the kitchen, after a while, he returned the food again like nothing happend) never again.",2,February 2016
The location is very strategic from dining to local activities and a spot for nightlife. The accommodation and room rates were very reasonable.

Yikes! They switched the AC with another AC which worked a little better. But the mosquitos, geez, they were having a feast on my account. The pool by the ocean had a weird fishy smell and my cousin stated had a ""poop"" smell...we stayed a few minutes and couldn't stand it so we moved on to the beach.

First, don't be deceived, only a portion of the hotel is beach front.  Most of the rooms are at the back and you will still need to walk a short road distance to the beach.  There would be better alternative stays at this distance.  Second, swimming pools are too small and always crowded.  One reason we booked this hotel was for the swimming pool, which we never used because it's always too crowded.  Third, breakfast is not good and VERY crowded.

No closets inside the room, just something protruding from the wall with hangers where you can hang your stuff.  We were given four bath towels--clean, but old and slightly brownish in color.

The room we booked online via Agoda seems like unavailable when we get there so they changed our room - change for the better. We had better room with the same rate. And me and my friends saved a lot, though it's all worth it.   The hotel's a beachfront.

I would recommend this hotel for families.  ",4,February 2016
The room does not look and live up to what was shown on booking/pics.  Towels were dirty...sink were all blocked up... rooms were not up to standards. Air-conditioning wasn't  great.

"Stayed in this hotel for five days, four nights - May 28-June 1, 2016. Location is excellent it's right at the beach in Station 2. La Carmela is also located near a 7-11, a police station and the coast guard office. They have a small pool where you can swim when it's too hot. The breakfast buffet is not the best but passable.   Staff are courteous and they have one guy whose sole job is to mop the floors of the corridors because of all the people coming in wet from the beach or pool. The beddings are threadbare. One complaint: You have to ask the front desk to clean your room and change your towels. Room service will not clean unless asked, which is probably good for security. While they explain this the minute you check in, frontdesk should also call the guests and offer to…",3,May 2016
"You can eat all you want with their buffet breakfast with different variety of foods from all over the Philippines, you can eat heavy or light breakfast, everything is there. The room looks great and the facilities were great too for a budget hotel like this.",4,June 2016
"Fifteen of us stayed for 3 nights at this hotel and huge part of why we enjoyed our trip was that we were not concerned with the safety of our belongings while staying here.  To start off, the location was great for us. It was at the very edge of Station 2 and since water activities usually begin at Station 3, we did not have very far to walk. It was, however, about a 10 minute brisk walk to D'Mall, but we took the tricycles so it was not a problem for us.  The rooms were comfortable enough, with the facilities working as expected. The patios were a nice addition to each room and we used ours to dry our wet clothes in. There was hot water, which was very much appreciated.  The staff were very friendly and always bade us a good day no matter what time we encountered them and no…",4,May 2016
"The front office service is slow. Check-in of guests are manually done. There is no system in their office. The room service is poor. Cleaning of room is upon request only and if you requested for the cleaning it took them so long before they will accommodate you. Bottled water is not available in the room there is one drinking station per floor. You have to go out of your room in order to drink. In the buffet area, Plates and utensils are not available. There is a delay in replenishing the buffet table. Guests from different functions are joined with the hotel guests in the breakfast buffet that's why the buffet was ran out of food. More fruits should be served.Same food was served for two consecutive days (Breakfast)",3,May 2016
"Location wise. Upsetting dirty sheets, towels, bathroom rugs and overall room quality. Overbooked yet undermanned. Worse part was this place used to be really good. The time it hasn't expanded yet was the better La Carmela. No in-room wifi. ",2,May 2016
"We arrived at 8am and the check in time is usually 2pm, but they immediately upgraded us to an executive room and said we could check in straight away! They have buffet breakfast available, which has quite a bit of variety and the hotel is right on the beach front! We had 3 queen sized beds in the room with fresh, clean linens and towels. The air conditioning made a little noise, but not enough to be annoying. The bathroom was simple, but clean and sufficient.   There are elevators here and the service is excellent - whenever we buzzed down to reception for extra toilet paper or towels, someone would come straight away. The only negative was that you have to pay for Wi Fi access and the signal wasn't always great. But overall, a very pleasant stay.",5,May 2016
"Hallway and rooms are dark, comfort rooms are too small and lack of complimentary stuff e.g tooth brush and toothpaste. 100php per request if you call the reception, for beach towel, you have to pay 50 per person, but in most hotels, beach towel are free of charge. Breakfast served just average, AC are not cold, too crowded reception not a relaxing place to check in. NOT RECOMMENDED to beach goers. The only pro, the staff that are accomodating, respectful and helpful.",2,May 2016
Satisfied with our stay 4D3N at the hotel even have delay check-in and its already past 2pm (due to peak season) but their frontdesk try their best to provide us room to check-in ASAP. The only issue is their noisy aircon and one of our room the aircon not cold enough to beat the summer heat.,4,May 2016
It's totally a horrible experience for 3 nights stay at this hotel that I never had even I used to stay at budgeted hotel such as Tune Hotel at even cheaper price! Non of us enjoy the stay! We just wish to run away from this horrible place! The only advantage is the location but to me I prefer station 1 as station 2 is too commercialise and crowded with ppl and a lot of noise!! I found most of the visitor were local ppl but rarely see foreigner!!   The quality of hotel totally not even in average standard! They even not provide hair dryer and universal adapter!   Front desk is not friendly at all! I book the room for 4 adult 1 kid but they force us to add an extra bed for a 10 years old kid at cost php500 but without breakfast! They claimed 10 years old not a kid but adult!  The…,1,May 2016
"We stayed here for 3 days and 2 nights for our outing last May 13-15 though room is a little bit cozy and bed linens were not clean and no drinking water inside the room, still our stay is good as they also served free breakfast, staff are accommodating and friendly. It is near the beach as well and they have entertaining shows during night time, value for money worth it as they offer cheaper rate.",4,May 2016
it was an ok hotel if you are in a budget. the a/c was not getting cold and we were not transferred to a new room until our last night stay. but like i said this place is ok. i guess u get what you pay for.,3,January 2016
"good: beachfront accommodation.  big hotel basic amenities well trained staff staff are available all the time to respond to your needs. maybe because we stayed right behind the front desk area.  pools. location is good (station 2 and almost at the boundary of station 1).  not so good: crowded at breakfast. food is so so but ok, but the canned fruit cocktail as dessert is just soooo cringeworthy. no mobile phone signal inside the room.",4,May 2016
"Let me start by saying ""if you want a vacay and wabt to stay in a small budget, you can stay here"". So here's my experience.. May 10-14 2016 stay. We arrived at 8 am in the hotel and since the room was available they allowed us to check in early which is great and we were assisted to our room in the 4th floor of the West building.  I was impressed with how the room looked like for the price I paid, it looked nice and clean and has a view of the pool. The floor had a little bit of sand though even if we just got there but it didn't bug me that much, I however think that they should have a pair of sandals/slippers inside the room...oh and if you have long hair you might want to bring your own hair dryer because they don't have one in the room. The air-conditioning was on full and…",4,May 2016
very bad service.  rooms are very dirty.  people not polite.    I would never stay here again. 3 nights never cleaned the room  1 time. pool looks good in picture but very small. breakfast very bad taisting. I  never finish eating the breakfast itt was soooo bad,1,April 2016
Easy access to attractions. View of both the ocean and the stage plus pool area. Great live fire dance show. Good breakfast featuring local food that we love. AC worked well and room was clean. Good amenities. Friendly staff.  Would definitely go back again.,5,September 2015
"Hotel is nice, provided the amenities needed. A/C in the bedroom didnt work but they changed the whole A/C system, I guess that's a plus. Food was ok, my daughter a staple (from the stapler) in her rice and it was rusty, they apologise and said it will be noted. Over all, accommodation was comfy, it did the job.",4,April 2016
"Pros: Hotel is nice. provides you the basic amenities needed. right size of room, strong A/C. clean room. comfortable bed. pool. friendly staff. free breakfast is ok. Location is also good. just a few steps to the beach.   Cons: bathroom is small. no bathtub (if your looking for it). no view other than the wall. yes there is pool, but it's small. No wifi signal at room. there are areas in the hotel, where mobile signal is poor.",3,February 2016
Beachfront but No wifi in rooms you still have to go dining area . but food buffet is good and cheap price during snack time. crowded places.big swim pool lots of people partying. still station 3 or 1 is the best choice .best of la carmela near d mall and market shopping areas and near bakeries and ofcourse its beachfront.,3,November 2015
"The hotel is a few minutes away to the beach and is between station 2 and 3 which is not as crowded as station 1. The hotel staff is very helpful, as far as room service they will not clean your room if you are not there for security reasons. Commodities in boracay are expensive so the hotel offers free purified water. The shower is spacious enough and the one we have has a little balcony in front of the pool that has a artificial waterfall so the room is filled with sound of waterfalls. ",5,April 2016
"Location: station3. Far from d'mall, starbucks, famous restaurants.  Resort: beachfront resort but rooms are far from the beach. About a minute or two walk. Resort is too big. More walking on the resort.   Facilities: small swimming pools. The one infront of the resort, near the beach is so so dirty. The other one at the back of the resort is so small but clean. Just for kids. 3ft below.  Food: ordinary, nothing special, limited choices for breakfast.  Room: bad air conditioning. good, new and clean comfort rooms in west building. Others are old and musty. Flat screen tv with cable. With balcony but has no view for rooms 105, 205, 207.  Price: pang ""masa"" resort. Full of Filipinos. Most of the travel agencies offers La Carmela De Boracay. (Most of the foreigners stays around…",2,May 2016
"The hotel was the venue for our seminar so we were also booked there. It was obvious that the main guests are big tourist groups. Not the place to relax in, too frenetic.  But the location is very good.  We stayed at the new building a few meters away from the beachfront building.  Food was ok during the seminar (lunch and breakfast).",3,December 2015
"Currently staying at La Carmela.room is good,clean and spacious but the terrace is facing a wall😕. No wifi inside the room..public areas like the resto has wifi passcode what the?!.staff are accomodating☺. There's 1 problem we encounterer last night, our room phone is ringging and seems like aomebody is talking on the other line.i called the front desk but line is kinda jammed so we just unhooked the phone for a peaceful sleep😊",3,May 2016
"Upon reaching our room, I had to request to have our toilet bidet fixed because no water is coming out. Also, there's no clothes hanger for hanging our wet clothes (but the rest of the rooms have theirs when I viewed their balconies!). I think ours was only room which didn't have one. We managed somehow so why bother. Pools were fine. Breakfast was ok. The rooms were just fine enough for my children to stay with the grandparents while my husband and I explored the island. Ask me if I would like to come back to this place, I think I'd go choose another place to stay. They could have done better.",3,April 2016
Would not recommend to anyone only positive is location and next to police station and beach.  The hotel itself: Mosquitoes everywhere even in room at least 10 i was bitten every night  Smells like sewerage everywhere  Still using keys  Wifi non existent even after purchasing their wifi for an hour  CLEAN YOUR AIR CON FILTERS THEY ARE DISGUSTING  poor water pressure  Staff at front unhelpful very lengthly check in and out and treat you like a criminal  Tell your front desk and public area to be careful of when they chit chat i am filipino but do not look it and understood all their immature comments  Final statement to management instead of using unnecessary staff cleaning every second small dust and water one is enough utilize that staff to clean room thoroughly including your…,1,April 2016
WHEN WE ARRIVE at the desk was isgoring us while using her cellphone when we got her attention she was rushing and when i saw her sha was texting and the room didnt look like in picture it wasnt well clean no fridge some ants near aircon smelled horrible breakfast was good problem  it tasted old and like fast food  exdcept not fresh last time never again,1,May 2015
"Its endorsement by a known personality does not make it credible, does it?  It is a big ""budget"" hotel that disguises itself as a four-star hotel.  I prefer the budget hotels I stayed in because there were no expectations and cleaner too. The breakfast was the same for the entire five days I stayed there (buffet). The lady at the front desk, had to tell me to sit and then call me later to just sign something or ask for a deposit or whatever - THRICE! The request for replacement of the floor mat, glasses took three days. The internet sucks. At least, the staff were courteous and polite.  Accessible too.",3,April 2016
Check-in experience was bad. We waited quite long since the front desk staff was chit-chatting with her friend. We booked for a standard room at the East Wing. The room was spacious but poorly maintained. The shower was leaking. You cannot get enough water unless you stand against the wall. It took them 2 days to replace the shower head.  Food was fine. We didn't realize that we need to present bfast coupons until our third day because were not given any and for two days they did not ask for it.  Rooms at the West Wing are better. Too bad they are fully booked during our stay. Location was great. It is in the beach front and we were able to eat bfast with a nice view outside the function room where they serve bfast.,2,March 2016
"La Carmela is a budget hotel that tries to come off as something else. The staff are polite but it's not genuine, they have to say that due to management. I was surprised that a lot of the staff couldn't help me when it came to finding a nearby laundromat. After asking 5 receptionists, I finally came across one person who could actually help me.  The breakfast wasn't the greatest and I found myself going out somewhere else in my 2 night stay here. The hotel is situated at station 3 and is a 15 walk up with station 1.  The rooms are very basic and could be cleaner.",2,April 2016
LOCATION:  - The hotel is at Station 3 but it is not too far from the restaurants and activities.  - It has access to the main road so it is very easy to get a tricycle if you are tired from walking.   STAFF:  - Friendly and nice staff especially the house keeping. I think they are one of the friendliest on the island.  ROOM:  - Air Conditioning is not so good since it is very small for the room that we booked. Our room has high ceiling so it takes a while before the room gets cooler.  - No WIFI provided which is not so good since the cellular network is kind of flaky.  - Spacious room but old and a little dark - Beds are not comfy enough but clean. The pillows are not comfy too.  - Water pressure is not strong and there is no hot water - Many broken fixtures but still okay  -…,3,August 2015
"When you wanted to enjoy the island on a budget this hotel is good choice.  The room is very spacious.  It can accommodate a maximum of 4 persons.  Everything is okay, the service is fast except for their buffet breakfast.  The food doesn't taste good, even the juices that they serve.  They should improve their buffer breakfast cycle everyday because that's something they overlook.",4,March 2016
"There's nothing fancy about this hotel, but when you're in Boracay you don't stay as much in the room because there's a lot of action going on outside. We got a family package room good for 4, and the price was reasonable for a 3D / 2N stay, the room given to us is in the executive wing, looking at it on the internet photos, it was big  but got quite disappointed when its just a normal sized room. Anyhow, included in the package was a set breakfast and a decent buffet dinner, just right on what we pay for.   If you're planning to get around Boracay and see its charm on a limited time, rather book in an average hotel so you wont spend that much.   Room Tip: get a room facing the beach, so you will see the real Boracay activity happening day and night.",4,March 2016
"We stayed here last March 2014 with my Family, since it is located in station 2 where all the shops, the market, souvenir shops, and bars are just a walk away. but Station 2 is also a bit crowded, The hotel has 2 pools, but the downside of it is for me it seems that some of the kids who are swimming in the pool near the beach area are not checked in at the hotel there was no control or a way to monitor if the people who are using the pool is a guest of the hotel, i do hope that they had done something about this already. But apart from that i can say that the service of the staffs are very good, the buffet breakfast is very worth it. The rooms are very clean and their rate are very reasonable.",4,May 2015
"We checked in for 4days 3 nights at the hotel but it's below our expectations. They only provide us with bath towels, no face towels in the room and there is No beach towels for us. The same towels need to be used if we go to the beach and get Sandy! No iron facilities provided for the room service.. not everyone coming with less clothes on. Breakfast is ever age and very minimum selections of the bread and cereals.  Hotel price isn't cheap but quality of the rooms and facilities is not up to the standard. The only plus points is for staff their very friendly and helpful. Revisit La Carmela?  I guess not .. Boracay offered better hotels with better price.",3,April 2016
i love the way they serve breakfast buffet!!! We went last Dec 2015 to celebrate our anniversary . the employee are very accommodating and friendly!!! Kudos to the owner of this hotel. I will go back whenever i will be coming back to boracay!,4,December 2015
"If you're looking for hotels in budget i think la carmela de boracay is best with their best rates, near to beach front and they have two pools so that its not too crowded as well, breakfast is nice and tasty with lots of variety, staff is really friendly ",5,July 2015
"We took a room for four (4) inclusive of breakfast for 3 persons, but staff are accommodating enough to give free breakfast to my kid for 5 days . Room is quite good, with two double bed, cable TV, hot & cold shower and free wife.  There are three swimming pools for kids to enjoy.",4,May 2015
"We stayed here as a group in Jan 2016. The rooms were musty, and over all filthy. There was hair on our pillows, toothpaste on our tap in the bathroom, the towels were grey and the bathroom was infested with ants. Housekeeping never picked up the dirty towels so we had a pile by the door by the time we left.  We had to call every day and ask for toilet paper, to which they brought half a roll. The rooms are noisy as the halls echo.  The food at the buffet was not appealing at all, we paid for the meals and only ate there once.  My friend had a hair in her food and when she showed the server, she took it and then brought it back to her stating the hair doesn't belong to any one in the kitchen!",1,January 2016
"About 16 of us checked into this "" 4 star resort"" Jan 28-31 2016. It was NOTHING like the pictures in the pamphlets. Every single person who was travelling had issues with the hotel. The rooms were disgusting. The sheets were dirty with hair and one friend even had blood on her sheets. It looked liked someone had there period on the white sheets. Ants all over the room and bathroom. Crawling up the walls in the shower. Rooms were musty. I asked to be moved to another room only to have the same issues. No shower door or curtain so water runs right out of the shower around toilet and floor. High risk for slipping and falling!!!.

Room lights are very dimmed, I hope lights can be improved too dark. Air conditioning is inefficient and noisy. No proper division of shower and toilet so toilet area gets flooded when you take a bath.

Rooms were small for the price you pay. The whole operation gives off as a very disorganized hotel. No sense of security. If you are into Philippine showbiz then this is the place for you. Otherwise better to look somewhere else. Place can get really crowded if they have showbiz people with tons of gawkers crowding the hotel entrance. ,2,March 2016
"The room was pretty average, the shower flooded the whole bathroom floor, not good. The breakfast was ok nothing fantastic. It was situated next to the beach it's only saviour in my book. Wouldn't stay there again. Would pay more and stay in zone 1.",3,March 2016

The 3-night stay wasn't that bad. T'was just okay. Good deal to be really near the beach front. Staff were nice and accommodating. WiFi can only be accessed in their restaurant only.

We booked our accommodation here through tripadvisor. When we arrived there the front desk associates were very accommodating and cheerful even though they were very busy that time but then they still have time to prioritize our requests. The housekeeping and F&B Staffs were hospitable and organised. Our stay here was all worth it with the price that we paid but I will suggest that this hotel will upgrade their food in the buffet especially during breakfast because as what we have noticed some of the food are to buttery and some are not good with the taste like it's lack of salt and spices then they keep on repeating the food that they served everyday so I think it will be best if you alternate the food that you serve but rest are all good!

We had a room in the newly built hotel building and the room was pretty neat and big. I personally did not wake up for breakfast so I can't really say anything about this. The hotel provided us a ride from/to the airport, including the ferry ride and everything was very organized. In front of the hotel, you have specific beach chairs for the hotel guests right at the beach if you wanna sunbath.The staff were very helpful.

6 of us stayed here. Staff was friendly. We were upgraded to the newer tower as a gift. We were staying for 10 days. Room was simple but clean. Great TV and channels for the sunburnt days. 1 min walk down to one of the best beaches I have seen in my life. also very close to a little grocery store. Breakfast was decent. Pancakes were always the best in the morning.  My only main complaint is wifi only works in the lobby and even then it was a struggle to connect most nights.,4,January 2016

I just think that La Carmela should invest the beach front of their hotel, as it was lacking of life.",5,March 2016
"It is not a 5-star by any streach, but the room is specious, clean and with a balcony. The towels, however, need updating. Dont expect an automatic cleaning of your room. You need to ask for it, which is ok. You can actually have it cleaned 3 times a day  if you want, but you have to ask.  The staff is great. Transport to the airport in hotel van is more convenient and cheaper than a tricycle. More western varities are needed for breakfast. I still dont understand why I have to have a breakfast for 2, when I am a solo traveler!!!",4,January 2016
"Good thing we paid for the transportation from the airport to the island included in our booking. After the flight from Manila, somebody picked us up help us with our luggage drove (a van) us to the boat that will take us to the island. Everything was fine, till we arrive in the hotel lobby, I still can't imagine there's no electricity, elevator was not on, no A/C! They do have generator but they have a cut off time, like they need to turn off the generator for 1-2 hours to have it rest! Ridiculous right? The room? Space was fine, but A/C was not that cold, I know the towels are not new but it looks old and disgusting to use, there's one little shampoo and conditioner that's it. No paper towels.

Anyhow, after all of those activities, you'll be longing fo   Hence, after all those tiring activities,  you will now longing to have some rest, and i can say la carmela is an average hotel you can spent your vacation with.

Staffs are very friendly and very accomodating. always smiling and they seems that they are very happy when serving guest. but one thing i dont like is the room we got. it is a package together with are plane ticket. it has a wall in the middle of the room that makes the room exhausted..  be sure when giving rooms to the travelers it should be convinient.,3,November 2015
"The worst hotel I've ever stayed in. We checked in around 10 pm and as soon as we walked in, we noticed a stingy smell and the ac unit running too noisy. I requested another room and encountered the same problem and for a small consolation, they actually replaced the ac unit w/ another one. The bathroom is dirty where you can see that it is not being cleaned regularly and that there are molds around the shower room and door. And the worst is their towels look like rags that you woul'nt dare to even use them to wipe your feet. It's really gross. And the breakfast, yuck.",1,February 2016
we have stayed at la carmela for all our stays in boracay and this is by far the worst of our stays.   room: the room looks run down.  - the towels seemed fraying and old and not so white.  - the AC was very cold though.  - no heating kettle.  - bathroom looks rundown and how ever much clean it is it still looks run down. - hot water was inconsistent for the shower and taps. it was so inconsistent that it's almost non existent.  - free drinking water though which counts for a lot. it saved us 200 php in drinking water per day. (for the whole family and we're a large water drinker) - the pool was too cold that the kids teeth were chattering once their bodies hit the water.  - the pool had a makeshift plug for a broken pipe cover that looks like it has been there for quite some…,2,February 2016
Staying for 4 Days 3 Nights at La Carmella (executive suites). 1. Clean room + bathroom 2. Provided:  + small freezer + kettle + tv 3. Helpful and friendly staff. 4. Really close with Station 2 Beach   Recommendation: + Provide wifi in the room as well. + Add more variety of food buffet. + Need to improve flush in the toilet  ,4,February 2016
"We stayed for one week. Pros: we had a kettle and a fridge. Also I appreciate the speed concierge worked on our requests. I advise you to take or buy there a soap and proper shampoo of your own. On the minus side, breakfast was 90% spicy eastern food, so we only went there two times. Reception girls were not very friendly. You have to register in their book for room cleaning.",3,February 2016
"We chose this hotel for our third visit to Boracay as the previous two (Le Soleil and Red Coconut) both had had issues with noise. We made the right choice. We booked 2 rooms over Chinese New Year for 3 nights and were given 203 and 208 in the Executive Wing. The rooms were fine. They were clean and comfortable with a good shower / bath, reasonable bed and the balcony was a good little place for an afternoon of drinks. Breakfast is adequate and the location is really near the beach. Staff are very polite. The one negative is the lack of wifi, but it meant getting away from the internet for a few days, which was actually fine. Boracay itself is now busier than ever, along with more touts and VERY aggressive selling, and this was the first time I saw it with an algae shore and…",5,February 2016
"We stayed here for 2 nights while visiting Borcay. The location is good as it's just a few minutes walk to the beach and the main strip of restaurants and bars.   The hotel is in 4 blocks, each with its own reception area, pool and breakfast room. The breakfast wasn't great so we ate at different places on the beach in the mornings.  The hotel is popular with tour groups and so there are lots of comings and goings. The rooms aren't sound proof so it can be quite noisy with people moving to and from their rooms.   The room was an adequate size with a decent bathroom. The towels and sheets were a little grey so they could do with being replaced but everything seemed clean. The housekeeping staff seem to need to be invited to enter the guest rooms and clean as they won't do it…",3,February 2016
"If you are not fussy, the room is okay. Dont expect too much. Location wise is great.  The only disadvantage was, other occupants are noisy at late night when they pass by the hallway. Same goes early in the morning. If you plan to sleep-in-peace during your stay, its not recommended. ",2,February 2016
"My family and i were super excited to be visiting Boracay and staying at La Carmela due to the walking distance to the beach and well high expectations (they have a board full of celebrities who have visited and stayed there)... Staff were nice and served us cold drinks upon check in and receptionist were nice too.. We walked into the room and was hit with a weird smell.. Maybe an insence? It wasn't pleasant it was very strong it gave us headaches. The room was an average size with two queen beds though the white sheets were borderline turning yellow... I also was looking forward to a balcony.. Though it was so tiny that only one person could stand there. Now, when i look for hotels i look for the cleanest ones, i walked into the bathroom and was immediately grossed out by the…",1,January 2016

"I heard that this place is one of the oldest hotel in Boracay. Having said that, it doesn't mean that La Carmela shouldn't do improvements in terms of building and services. One the internet connection was no where to be found, no internet services at all. Two the restaurants was full of mosquitoes especially those tables in the far to the windows area. Three, the hot water is not working properly and I have heard from the adjacent room that the toilet is leaking with bad smell. If this is how La Carmela handle their guests and I believe that it should be improved or else it will starts to loose their guests",2,February 2016
Been here once in 2012.  Our stay was good enough and very much budget friendly. The hotel is already beach front and accessible to the market and restaurants.   We look forward to staying here again in our next Boracay trip.,4,March 2015
"Last year, around feb, we stsyed in la carmela. Arriving at night, we were greeted by a cute receptionist.  Pros Great location Almost beach front Buffet breakfast Attentive staff Price  Cons, Very slow wifi(do they know that dial up is out of date?) Haha Network signal (both smart and globe) are very poor. I had to go beach front just to get signal. Pool is dirty. Did they forget to clean?  I guess you get what you pay for. For a 3 star resort, its pleasant. ",4,March 2015
"At first of all the breakfast is horrible. Unfortunately we arrived at wrong time, because there was many chinese people. The swimming pool dirty. The room is suitable. The wifi connection is terrible. You can find to the other building, and you going to be lucky if you can connecting once a day. The staff kind but inelastic and not professional. The philipines people should learn from thai pepole. Never come back ",1,February 2016
"We're 'upgraded' to a new block.  Some of the floors still under construction.  The room was big to accommodate 2 queen size bed & 1 single bed.  However the aircond unit is too small to efficiently cool off the room.  Wifi in general was poor even if you opted to buy prepaid SIM, the free wifi provided by the hotel didn.t help much.  Breakfast disappointedly very average every morning.  The plus point is only about the location.  The lane going through the hotel will lead straight to the centre of Station 2.  You can drop exactly in front of the hotel without have to drag your luggage bag through the sand.",2,November 2015

"My husband and I were at La Carmela for a few days. The staff were friendly, the room was clean and the food was ok. The hotel is located right in the heart of Station 2 and was really easy to get around to Station 1 & 3.

We would definitely come back here if/when we go back to Boracay!",4,February 2016
"this is my review on the La Carmela De Boracay Station 2, upon arrival since we are very early as in early 3 am we arrived from Kalibo Airport, we were supposed to check in early (already coordinated this to front desk but my mistake in not getting her name) anyway since there is no available rooms, we were not accommodated and we were forced to get other near by accommodations since we have 3 kids with us, but with assurance from the front desk that we will be allowed for early check in around 10 to 11:30 am. so we started our first day in Boracay beach while waiting for the availability of our rooms, come 11;30am we returned to check in with front desk, we were informed that we need to check out first with our current hotel before we can check in with them and we need to bring…",4,January 2016
"The location was great-- right at the beachfront.  Our room (good for four) is well- maintained. We stayed here for four days, and I think it was pretty decent. The breakfast buffet was just okay. The food doesn't taste that great. I had a difficult time finding a place to eat my breakfast since the dining hall was usually full. The service given by the staff was also okay. Not exceptional, but they were accommodating enough to our requests.",4,May 2015
"Nothing special in the hotel, however they have a cozy bed & rooms. Few staffs especially in the reception area. A receptionist looks busy in receiving phone calls and responding to the guests in the counter. Good food in the breakfast. Aaaaand! Location! I and my wife really love the location which is beach front and it is very close to different restaurants and even convenience store. You can also see a lot of tour guides who offers tour packages! Well do not settle to the first person who offers package, look for others who offers same packages yet cheaper price! Well, we really enjoyed our stay in Bora. ",3,February 2015

If there are only consolation are the 3 servers: Red, Alvil (who helped me buy a toy) and Jemiah (who assisted us in sterilizing).

Since we are 1st Timer we availed the Transfer. I would suggest you do the same. Room was nice and there is a Veranda you have coffee and relax after having a long night.

The rooms are ok, we stayed in a de luxe room for 4 and the size is just right, beds are comfortable.  Boracay is a very nice and fun place to be with your family and friends.  There are so many activitivies to do during the day like helmet diving, snorkling, jet sking, parasailing, islang hopping, scuba diving etc and at night there are so many bars along the beach at stattion 2 which have entertainment.

Location is great because it is near everything- beachfront, public transport, shopping area. The staff are super accomodating and courteous.The owner is very generous and friendly.

The room smells like poop, no hair dryer, towels requested to get replace, room cleaning you have to go to the front desk to sign something after calling them to place request and beach towels rental. Takes forever to get service if you call the front but there are bunch of OJT in the floor. The breakfast buffett is not good and the line is way too long.

The place is over crowded largely because they have so many rooms but despite the crowd the staff is polite had helped us with quick check in. The rooms in perimer west wing have decent room with very small balconies. They hotel has some very strange policy of providing towels only at request, which was very supprising for us. The Wi-Fi is only available at hotel reception which was not working properly. Overall the hotel didn't meet our expectations....",2,December 2015
"Very affordable and reasonable price. The location is very good, it has a beach front that lots of people swim to (contrary to other beach front hotels that are occupied with boats, thus, not really good for swimming and relaxing). The hotel provides free use of beach chairs and umbrellas infront of their hotel, which is very convenient for people who doesn't want to be too exposed to the sun. The price is really worth it, considering that it is a beach front and that breakfast is included. The rooms were ok, small but functional, worth the price, clean, usable, properly maintained, everything you need is inside, really a practical if you are just going to use it for a good night sleep. the breakfast is ok, really good for the price you pay, although some of the dishes were a…",4,December 2015

"The hotel is in a good location close to the beach in Station 2. Overall the room was clean and staff friendly. However for what you pay don't expect standard hotel services like being able to charge food and beverage to the room, daily room make-up, free bottles of water daily, the ability for housekeeping to replace towels and a fridge that stays on even when the keys shut off the rest of the power. Our drinks and ice cream was warm and melted after being out all day. The included breakfast was cold and unappealing so much so that we ate breakfast outside the hotel a couple of times. We did enjoy the New Year's Eve dinner buffet and entertainment.",2,December 2015
"Rooms are too small and not well maintained. Walls are dirty, mirror in the bathroom has a big stain. Even found a dead lizard on the bed! The hallways and the room smell musty.

The towels and bedsheets are clean and fresh and can be replaced upon request, too. The shower room is pretty spacious. however, you might want to take extra caution with the slippery tile floor. The room we had on our second-time stay had a little balcony which can be used as a smoking area and doubles as a little ""laundry"" area where you can hang wet swimsuits or towels, too.

"I stayed here from the 9th - 16th December 2015 at room 403. I am terrible disappointed at this hotel, they only clean your room when you ask and they tell you to sign a book for responsibility if no one is in the room while they are cleaning.

"La Carmela De Boracay is quite a decent hotel for those who are looking for an affordable accommodation, friendliness and hospitality are very welcoming from the start to finish. The hotel also has three swimming pools for the little ones to enjoy. I highly recommend hitting up ""Jonahs Milkshake"" It is the best milkshake on the island this can be found in Station 1, you can either walk down the strip or take a tricycle.   If you love seafood their is a local seafood market located behind the beach front, you can buy a variety of seafood and have them cooked by the restaurants nearby it is the most tastiest freshest food you will indulge in  Boracay is voted as one of the most beautiful islands in the world, A place worth visiting",5,December 2015
"The hotel has a section of beach that it owns and provides lounge chairs for its guests. The room was clean and the beds were comfortable, but you shouldn't be spending that much time in the room. There was free Wi-Fi in the lobby only, but no business section available, strictly a beach vacation hotel. Buffet was top notch with a wide variety of food. Great location as we did almost everything not far from the hotel. We did scuba diving, shopping, night-life entertainment, etc. We stayed in rooms that were a small walk to the beach on the back part of the hotel, but it helped because it was quieter from the nightlife.

That is the only 3 menus available always and everyday during 9:45am. Hope they can improve the restaurant. The buffet -not so tempting to eat there also. The front desk ladies needs to be more helpful as they asked me to check all the reception area myself when I was waiting for a CD delivery of my watersports activity.

Their meal times (especially breakfast) are quite long enough for early birds and for those who are lying in... The food isn't the best but good enough for a 3-star hotel. Some points for improvement are: wi-fi, tv channels, fridge, pool. Wi-fi is far too slow and very limited connectivity. TV channels are crap, that you can't even watch national tv. The mini fridge is not even cooling a couple of bottled drinks... The swimming pool is not very conducive for singles as it's mostly packed with parents and their kids.

"We've stayed at this hotel way back in 2012 and we liked it . So we went back to this place not to stay but for our hungry tummy. Breakfast buffet is an amazing treat especially if you need energy throughout the day, from hot and cold drinks to pasta and other carbs with local cuisine on the table at a very affordable price.

If you are looking for a hotel in boracay that is IN THE BUDGET. I would recommend this Hotel to stay. If you are to expect a bali kindda theame this hotel is not right for you.    The hotel itself will give you the basic amenities you need to stay in. Its also close to the beach. The food is nice and average price. Overall our stay was good.,4,November 2015
"It is my first time to travel to Boracay and because there are a lot of guests who prefer to stay in this hotel due to its location, I was convinced to book my entire stay. We arrived late and yet no one bothered to helped us with our luggage except with Manong tricycle driver. the impression gave me a second though of moving to another hotel but then again, plans are already made. The worst thing that a property cannot offer is WiFi and I was surprised that there is no WiFi available in the rooms. Terrible! The room is too dark that even the bulb cannot lighten the whole room.",3,April 2015
"Dirty, unhelpful, aircon didn't work, totally inefficient, unfriendly staff, bad location, I could go on and on. But if you're thinking of booking here I can't stress enough how bad this place was. Honestly I wouldn't stay here for one night even if the hotel paid me 25,000 PHP. It was completely insufferable. ",1,December 2014
"It's a nice hotel for budget conscious travelers. The breakfast is not that good compared to other hotel in the area, but if your budget is tight and you want a hotel with swimming pool at the beach front then this is a good choice. The rooms are spacious. We will come back again next time.",5,December 2014
"We booked a room for 2 adults (Thursday to Saturday at the building away from beach front) but when we arrived and saw our then 2 y.o. child they upgraded our room to the next one up. They juice offered upon arrival was the regular out of the foil pack- plain. The room we were in was on the third floor overlooking the pool. Room had a homey feeling to it and the beds were just what we needed after carrying our kid the entire trip. We really didn't stay at the hotel much as we mostly strolled along the beach front.  The only free Wifi was at the lobby. Room wifi had an extra charge.  Buffet breakfast though not the best, is not the worst. The usual you may find - sunny side up eggs, hotdogs, fried rice, plain rice, pancakes, fresh fruits, juice and ice tea, coffee.  At the end of…",4,May 2015
"As someone had said before, you get what you paid for. For the price you get a room with a bed, a shower and breakfast included.  Check in was very slow, especially with the usual lecture on the rules and extra charges. Hotel seems to cater to mainly large tour groups from Korea, and groups of locals. Wifi only available in the lobby and restaurant, and very hit or miss at best; very slow with lots of dropouts, better wifi available on the street. OK for checking email but not much more. Room rather basic, and only cleaned upon request. Shower has very poor water pressure. Breakfast was cafeteria style, very busy, with mostly Asian food available. Many restaurants close by if you are after something more substantial.  Overall good for a short stay, but would look for something a…",3,November 2015

Got to the hotel at 3pm and there were a lot of people checking in. The person who attend to us during the check in talked too fast that i couldn't understand her anymore. She was explained the house rules and all she talked about were additional fees or charges that we can incur during the stay. She said we got a free room upgrade but when we got to our room it was like a downgrade. The room had 3 beds and my reservation was for just 2 people. It was ackward because its just me and my boyfriend and there were 3 beds. There was a small deck but when you open the door all you see is walls because its was right beside another building. The hot and cold shower was not working. It was just cold water and it doesn't even give us enough water to have a decent shower. The hotel crew…,2,September 2015
The buffet was great. I just felt that the aircon was not so cool and too small for the room I have. Their room service was also efficient and reliable. The location was a bit far from bars and D-mall.. Overall my stay was OK.,4,September 2015
"We booked for panorama and main deluxe rooms online for 12 adults and 5 kids for 3 days 2 nights but we were informed on the phone that kids are not allowed in the panorama so they will book us to main deluxe and 2 semi deluxe rooms. When we arrived, the rooms weren't arranged yet so we went for lunch and came back at 1.30pm and we were advised that the 2 other semi deluxe rooms are not available and that they will have to check for other available rooms. After a lot of discussions, they have arranged 3 main deluxe rooms. So we had to wait for another hour after check in time.

"Room was small and no windows.   Had comfy beds and pillows.  The towels are blackish whites though, and the smell of the water from the tap was like they're flowing from rusty pipes.   Would be hard for someone to dry wet clothes as there's no space to do that.  The restaurant is very handy serving buffet breakfast, lunch or dinner with reasonable prices.    Housekeeping and reception staff were both quick to attend to our needs.   Just a pity that we found some rubbish at the hallway which was left/dumped by uneducated guests.  No wonder we found a cockroach in our room on our departure day.   Would recommend booking the pick up departure travel arrangement with the hotel as that made it easy and convenient for us and cost was reasonable.",3,October 2015

"The room was big enough for two =) Although we stayed at the attic, it's not that unpleasant going up and down with the use of the elevator.  The breakfast was good, basic filipino cuisine and i guest they cycle that same  menu's after the third day.   The location was great- front beach, near everything.  The staff are very happy, helpful and concerned people. They always have a friendly smile.",4,September 2015

Me and my family stayed here for 4 days during our stay in boracay. The room was ok. The comfort room was good too with a bath tub and television with cable. The price was also ok not pricey at all. The breakfast buffet was not that good and very oily and theres no wifi at the room.,3,November 2014

La Carmela de Boracay is swak for budget-conscious traveler.  We availed of the family package ( 4 adult and 1 child) with free breakfast (set meal) and buffet dinner.  My grand daughter enjoyed swimming in the pool. The room has 2 big beds and has cable tv.  The hotel is beach-front and you can enjoy the sunset just across the hotel.  We're just sad it has no wifi.  I'm going back to boracay and will stay at la carmela again.,3,October 2015
"The hotel is just your regular accommodation, perfect for budget-oriented travelers and big family groups. Small rooms, had some bug bites, and mediocre swimming pool. Not much really to do here, you can't even relax for a second because of the number of guests around. Just too many. The shower handle was dilapidated, too. Our group was composed of 32 extended family members that's why we decided to get this. No need for relaxation here as the intention is not to relax but more on family bonding.   If you have more budget to splurge, give yourself a break and do not book here, if your goal is to relax.",3,October 2015

We upgraded our lunch and dinner into buffet so we added 500 per person so that you can have a buffet breakfast lunch and dinner for 3D&2N. Its all worth it!!!!! Super worth it!! Very delicious choices of food especially on breakfast but the thing is their egg has no taste but its okay hahaha. The hotel was very clean and smells good.

"La Carmela de Boracay is I think the most affordable hotel resort in Boracay if you want  to stay in Station 2 (almost station 3), and in a beach front property. Although most of the rooms here do not have ocean views, they have quite a lot of rooms in quite a lot of wings with swimming pools (I have seen 3). Even if you stay in the other wings, beach front is still accessible via the main wing.   Rooms are very spacious! A room is very good for 4 people! Rooms are clean as well as the bathroom which offers the basic amenities. I love that there are drinking water stations (hot and cold) in every floor.   I always love the breakfast buffet that serves Filipino food and quite a number of offerings already for the price that you pay.  We went there during the Labor Day weekend /…",3,May 2015

"Last March 26-28, 2015, my cousins and I flew to Boracay to release some Metro stress. During planning, we decided to book everything thru a travel agency. As far as I remember, agency was 'Travel Online'.  Agencies typically partner with La Carmela for travel packages in Boracay. We were okay with the rooms given as they were spacious and offer comfy beds. La Carmela is okay for Boracay-goers with just so-so budget but still above the satisfactory service.  They offer welcome refreshements which should be a standard for all hotels, not sure for others though. Crew were accommodating and hospitable.   There were a whole lot of Koreans during our stay. Not meaning to be discriminating but queue during breakfasts were disorganized. We could have used some assistance from the hotel…",4,March 2015
"La Carmela is actually cheap and an average hotel. Booked this hotel together with my family for 4days stay. They originally gave us the room on the ground floor but there's no cellular service so I have asked to change room, I got annoyed when they gave me a room right across it so they obviously didn't listen to my complaint. They eventually gave me us a room in the attic. Room is ok. Room service is upon request. Shower is low pressure. I couldn't feel the AC but tolerable but other than that it was ok. The place has a good locatipn so yhats a plus. I would probably stay here again with family because it has reasonable pricebuffet breakfast was average",3,September 2015

The breakfast wasn't good and we didn't like the food, I'd recommend not to buy breakfast and have it some place else.  The internet connection was really terrible and only at the reception. Packed with foreigners all the time, the staff told us that the internet kicked us off all the time because it has a limitation of wi-fi connections and due to the reception being packed it was kicking us out.

It was a good stay.  Their space can accomodate big group like ours with sufficient halls to provide for the guests.  Their buffet servings were excellent and we truly enjoyed their food. It was its location that turned me off.  It could have been great if it gets a little closer to the center of the station 2. ,4,March 2015
Very nice hotel in Station 3. The location is just right. Walking distance to Station 2 where the party places are. It's quite and we had a buffet dinner when we stay there. They have 3 building if I ain't mistaken. They have swimming pools on each buildings. The rooms have balconies and very simple and neat.,4,October 2014
You get what you pay for in this hotel. This hotel is really good for backpackers. Beachfront and just few minutes walk to D mall and D talipapa.  Daily breakfast was good and tasty. The only downside is there is no bottled water inside the room. And you have to request for room make-up for them to clean your room. Just right for budget conscious like me who wants to enjoy life to fullest.,3,September 2015
"Good points 1. Beach front / easy access 2. Budget friendly 3. With small veranda that you could use in drying your clothes.  4. Room was okay. Enough space to move around. You'll be out the wholeday anyhow.  5.. Lastly, we arrived at 8:40am. The receptionist allowed us to checked in at 10:20am, if I'm not mistaken. Given that the standard check-in is at 2pm.

The property has pools, one facing the beach.   Some heads up to those checking in at La Carmela: (1) You need to print your hotel voucher. I just don't understand why they can't just pull up your name while presenting an ID. Good thing I always have a printed itinerary; (2) Skip the free breakfast. I can't even explain how it taste. Eggs?  Runny will be an overstatement, it was watery and has no taste; (3) Sone rooms do not have cellular connections.  I ended up in a room without connection and gloomy.

We stayed here for 4 days in a Standard Room. Everything was okay. Room service was fast. Housekeeping was fine. Free breakfast buffet was not as bad as expected.   Ups: - Beach front location. Few minutes walk to D'Mall. - Budget friendly rooms - Outdoor shower + pool (Good for removing sand before going to the room) - Accommodating staff  Downs: - Bed bugs (We didn't see any but we went home with a couple of bites) - No mobile phone signal inside the room,4,August 2015
I must say the attendants are customer service oriented. Since I went to Boracay to enjoy outdoor activities so I have no big fuss on the hotel amenities but in fairness the room was clean. Only thing was that wifi access is not free plus mobile signal gets too low so I have to go outside my room and find a good spot for signal. im a globe user by the way. breakfast buffet is not fantastic but you can always hit the nearest resto as its walking distance to d mall and other nice restos. generally my stay has been good. This is a budget friendly hotel with very good location.,3,August 2015
The best thing about La Carmela de Boracay is its location. It's located beach front and in the middle of the stations. It’s very accessible. The rooms are really small but clean. The staff are kind and courteous . The not so good thing about it is its breakfast buffet.,3,February 2015

"We recently stayed with La Carmela in late Aug 2015 over a 5 days/4 nights period. We booked the Panorama VIP Room in the Executive Wing. The room itself was quite large and fitted us and our extended family easily. However, we needed to be careful as the upstairs ceiling was very low. Two of our group hit their head on the ceiling and got quite a large bump on their heads (and we aren't very tall people).  Customer Service was lacking during our stay. Everyday, we had to call reception to ask them to clean our room and provide us with new water bottles. Since we wanted to get the room cleaned whilst we were out, it meant that we had to walk down to reception everyday and sign something to allow them access to the room while we were out.

What's nice about this place is that it's so near the beach just a few steps away but I find it too crowded. Mostly come by groups or by family. The breakfast dining area both the new and the old building are always full and you need to wait to be seated and so embarrasing especially for foreigners that they have to wait for the food and drinks to be replenished by the staff ( took them so long). The front desks staff are not that friendly and courteous maybe because of stress  but the bell boys are accommodating. Hallways and in our room has leaks hopefully they'd have it fixed cause the facades of both buildings look nice. If you are looking for a more serene place this is not for you.,3,December 2014
"We stayed at the La Carmela because they're a bit cheaper compare to the other beachfront hotels and the rooms are good for 4 persons, so I guess we saved a lot for that. Our room was located somewhere we still needed to walk as if walking to a hotel that is located behind a hotel... I'll never forget how I try to sleep there at night because  their aircon was too noisy. And our room had a view of what it looks like construction area. They have buffet breakfast, but nothing special. Their pool looks dirty and the toilet beside it too.

We arrived earlier than check-in time of 2:00pm and we were allowed to get a room right away so at first i thought that it was good but when I reached the elevator there is a sign on how much it would cost you for internet service. Imagine a hotel with no free Internet for guests! We all know that all guests need it, and we need it for free and should be part of their accomodation.

It's a good beachfront hotel at Station 2 so you don't need to walk far just to get to the beach. However what I have noticed for the 3 nights stay here, breakfast is the same every morning. Nothing new was added on the list daily. The taste is not so good just ordinary. I hope there is something new every morning since their market here stays usually for 2 or 3 consecutive nights. For the swimming pool since it is beachfront, it seems that everyone is welcome to use it. No one's asking for the room number.

Not only is there a list of rules on check-in but a laminated copy in the room and signs everywhere.  You need to request cleaning each day and sign a waiver if you’re not in the room when they arrive.  Ice is pp50 but they always inform you before delivery and I had no problem with that.

You can't sleep peacefully because of the noise coming from the water tank? (I'm not sure)   Breakfast was just average. Nothing to expect. Just the usual and some left over food from last night.

Poor mobile network signal means you have to bank on wifi which isn't free. None of the rooms have a view. Faulty AirCon. Had to change the room once because of it. Problems with hot water in both bathroom. Something wrong with their system. The maintenance comes and are able to fix it but it's a nuisance. Breakfast buffet is very poorly run. Menu is the same every day and they weren't prepared for the number of people even during off season. You have to wait in a queue to get everything. 2 motor pump stratergically placed ensure that none of the rooms are spared from the noise made while pumping up water to the overhead tanks.

"we had a standard room for the second time. nothing great..just fair. they have two pools, the pool in west wing is much better than at the front beach. if you're looking for a budget hotel...this one is not bad. besides it's few steps from the beach.",3,July 2015
"The Front Desk people were accommodating and provided clear instructions on their rules and regulations. They also provided us complimentary juice while we were waiting for our room. We thought the hotel looked impressive for such an affordable rate. However, we were disappointed with our experience in the room.  There were no elevators so we had to carry our luggages all the way to 3rd floor. We stayed for a night only and the floor was dusty after we unpacked our stuffs, so we asked for a sweeper.The AIRCON was noisy, and it suddenly stops like it's battery empty. So we had to get up in the middle of the night many times to check on it. So it cools the room for while. Good thing it was a rainy season, so it wasn't that hot. WIFI is not loading any of my pages.

"The rooms was good for sharing but if you want the nicer view you need to choose the room facing the ocean (expensive room). Their food was just simple, still delicious. The pool was fantastic (wear proper attire ex. Swimwear) Hope that the pool will be 24 hrs. :)",3,October 2014
"Basic hotel with rather poor amenities provided.  Experienced a blackout while we were there.  Few steps away to the beach. Breakfast was nothing fantastic, huge flies to accompany you while you eat.  Pool was packed with locals. Pretty disgusting to see the pool packed with people as such.   However, their service staff were friendly and accommodating. They were willing to render help, even their security guard to ensure that you are right on track. They helped us find our guide who were not there during the stipulated timing. Apparently, they know one another hence brisk business for the guides.   The money spent is proportional to what you get for the stay.  Don't expect too much because really, it's mediocre.",3,August 2014
"Do not book online here. Shower was blocked and toilet did not flush or drain, staff were hostile and room was nothing like what was shown online and hardly worth the $70 we payed for it. Dirty, grotty and tired and was packed with loud obnoxious guests. We're not fussy at all but found cleaner, nicer, friendlier accommodation for cheaper just three doors down! Book at own risk.",1,July 2015
"The room we had was nice and new, with 2 double beds. It was for 2 people. I don't know why they won't let additional persons in the room. I was willing to pay extra for my cousin and sister to stay in the same room but they said it's not allowed. The room was big enough for 4pax. The small balcony faces a wall, which was about 3feet away from it.  They have polite staff and very efficient cleaners. They charge P50 for the use of a beach towel... towels that have seen better days.  We tried to call the management's attention about a (major) problem TWICE. We informed two different personnel but nobody did anything about it.",3,March 2015
"Check in took awhile for they were looking for the other people that were supposed to be staying with us but couldn't make it due to family's death which caused frustration after flying all the way from Manila with long road traveling to get to the hotel. They said we couldn't check in until they saw everyone's ID's. If the room was already paid for months and months in advanced, why does it matter if 2, 3 or 4 people showed up for a room that's fully paid for and to accommodate 4? After check in, my cousin and I were excited to go to the room for some rest for we were dead tired from our trip. The room was pretty small, window view was a wall (made us feel like we were locked up) so we saw no sunlight and made it very dark in the room even with all of the lights on, placed by…",3,November 2014
"The only good thing about the hotel is its proximity to the beachfront. Aside from it, other else are poor to average. The room and the hotel facilities are already old and smells awful as if someone has been smoking inside. The toilet lacks lighting, it seems dark and dirty. At times, the hot shower is not working. The elevator in the main building is always under maintenance. The staff in the front desk are friendly but the others are not polite at all. You can only access the internet at the bar or pool area but the signal is oftentimes weak. Although the hotel offers cheap accommodation, I think there are other hotels that could offer better service and quality given the same price.",2,July 2015
"We traveled to Boracay just this mid of July, 2015 and its once again being practical and street-smart is always a plus. Along with wife and 2 daughters, we took the Manila-Kalibo-Caticlan route cause we wanted a bigger plane (Caticlan airport accommodates only small planes as of now) and its worth it. The 1 hour and 45 minutes Kalibo to Caticlan is worth it, we rode the Southwest bus, its comfortable, a lot of baggage space and the view is spectacular (a mixture of the zigzag road of Baguio and the sea coastline of Quezon), you can ride a taxi or van but it might be a little cramped inside. Then after a 7 minute ride from Caticlan port to Boracay, we reached the pier and we were brought to our hotel - La Carmela de Boracay.

We went here for a short vacation and stayed for a 3 days and 2 nights. Rooms were clean enough and we had a nice sleep. I like the fact that it's near the beach and they have swimming pool as well. We really enjoyed the beach of course. Staffs were okay enough that they greeted/smiled at us. Food was kinda okay. Price was sort of reasonable.,4,June 2015
La Carmela is overall a nice place to stay when in Boracay. It's 2 minutes away from the beach. A little far from D'mall though. I'm sorry but my friends and I didn't like the breakfast food at all. It's bland and we weren't excited to eat breakfast at all. :(,3,July 2015
"The hotel room was small, smell  the toilet cover  will not sit up but sit on your back when you used the toilet. I feel dirty once I used the toilet because of the toilet cover that sit on my back.  The lobby of the west wing was small for the people to wait for your bus. The breakfast food is not good . We give away to the people our food voucher because the breakfast foods was not good. You have to asked toilet paper and towel everytime you need it. The people are very accomodating or the workers. The wifi is only  in the big lobby that u have to cross the road to have a wifi. The over all feeling of our stayed in this hotel is just like   we are in the market place. Chaos  I will not recommended to any one unless you are in the budget.",2,June 2015
"When to Boracay with family and friends we were 23 pax and the hotel was able to accommodate us. Rooms were equipped with led cable tv, cabinet with password secured box, hot and cold shower, 2 double sized bed with lamp shade. It was nice that the room has veranda but no nice view. We just used the veranda for clothes drying.   The beach front pool was cool but it was a key for ""security issues"", the hotel was too open that even visitors not checked in can enter and roam around the place. 3 pools were available for guest, 2 adult pools 1 with sauna and 1 kiddie pool.   As for food, the hotel service took too long but food taste was good. Serving was enormous for 4pax, we did not consume the serving because we were too full with the amount of food.

"La Carmela de Boracay is located at the white beach Boracay island station 2. Great family hotel, Beachfront resort/hotel, buffet breakfast, near resto and bars, good value for money. Our package includes 3D2N accommodation in La Carmela with 4pax daily buffet breakfast, with roundtrip transfer with All-In fees via Southwest boracay.

La Carmela is so nice. Each hotel room has their own style. Like the roon we used it has a mezzanine which is good for five person. I was amazed about that because it was my first experienced to stay their and niece choose that for us. One thing also about the food that they serve. For the amount wepaid was so affordable because buffet is set for the breakfast. Besides there are some resto outside wich so easy to get there. Very accommodate the whole staff was so pleasant and hospitable anytime you ask for something they're always ready to assist.  The hotel is a beach front at the station 2 fo the Boracay Island.   My first experience to stay at the hotel is unforgetable because I had a great time at the La Carmela Hotel.,5,August 2014
"The place is nice. It was my second time in Boracay and checked in here. It was just average. Too far from D'mall even both are in station 2. Too popular that's why it's crowded even in the month of June.  The room we had was good for 4 pax. Unfortunately network signal was very poor. Nothing fancy for the buffet breakfast and we were having same menu for 3 days that we were checked in there. Additional buffet breakfast is not worth it, just buy food outside. Try the shawarma rice booth/stall just few steps away from the resort.",4,June 2015

"My friend and I was in Boracay for a week last January.  We stayed in 3 different places:  one night in an INN, two nights here at La Carmela, another 3 nights in another resort/hotel in Station 1.    I was really curious about the quality of service in La Carmela as a resort/hotel, the food, the service, efficiency and all. This is due to its popularity amongst young people and families that stays there.  The more I get curious when I learned that it is endorsed by Boy Abunda.  I also have read a lot of negative comments about La Carmela, so the more I got really curious and decided to stay there for 2 nights.  Our room was in the executive wing, it was very decent, spacious, smells good when we first entered.  The size of the bed is good enough for a couple (with a kid).  The…",3,January 2015
"You get what you need. The room was average with basic facilities (bed, tv, a/c). The a/c should be upgraded. The bathroom, was okay but the opposite side of the shower floor should be elevated. The bathroom comes  with toiletries, but towel change are upon request for free. Linen change and room cleaning are also upon request. Location-wise, it's good because it's in Station 2. The lobby and front desk could be very busy. Breakfast and food choices are basic, and can be improved.",3,June 2015

The airconditioning is a crap. I called the receptionist for this, and after 10 minutes a guy came to change the AC without checking if it is working well or not. The thing is the set up of the room is not good and there's a wall between the bed and the location of the AC. Eventually, they move us to another room with the same condition. Really super hot, we couldn't sleep well. Another thing is there is ZERO network or wifi in the room! Nothing! And they charge 100 pesos per hour!

"My family and I stayed here last month (June 2015) and the hotel was packed with lots of people. What attracts a lot of people to La Carmela is the fact that its affordable (our room came with free breakfast). So dont expect to come to La Carmela to have some peace and quiet, there are lots of families, lots of young kids, and can be quite noisy at times.   Our room had airconditioning, a TV, and one bathroom with shower and spa. Though it probably wasnt the greatest hotel room, we didnt mind because we spent 95% of our time outside enjoying Boracay anyway.   Location is really nice. From the pool, you are literally a few steps away from the beach so that was definitely a plus!  The only main concern I had was the breakfast food. There were a lot of choices but a lot of the food…",3,June 2015

The hotel check-in was painless even though there were big groups around the time we arrived. We were given a free room upgrade to boot. The hotel is just a few steps away from the white sand beach.  There are security cameras in key areas which gives us comfort in leaving things in our room.  Basic breakfast food was acceptable, though there was a queue and some waiting for food to be replenished.  We had a pleasant time overall and found things as promised.",3,July 2015

Hotel accomodation of La Carmela de Boracay was okay but not as great as I expected it to be. Drinks were served and we were brought to our rooms. We occupied two standard rooms in the sense that we'll not have our vacation in hotel rooms.

Indeed, we were given cheap accommodation. Shabby hotel room, dirty looking towels and linens, non functioning refrigerator and broken airconditioning.   We were offered plated meals so we were encouraged to upgrade it to a buffet for a cost. So we availed it.  The biggest mistake for it was nothing but a bland, tasteless junk.

As we are tall we people we had no chance of fitting 2 people on these beds. We told them but they insisted this was a queen bed.

The veranda is okay but the air condition is very poor. Please replace the air conditioner of that room. PLEASE! That's all.",4,May 2015
"Stayed for 2 days with my officemates. Wifi is available near the front desk area. There is no wifi in the room, if you need wifi you have to pay 150 per hour. It is very hard to coordinate with their staff. The room is just fine but the  food is not good.",2,May 2015
"I like the location of this hotel. I stayed three nights. The rooms are dated. Service is so so! It is a beachfront place, however it was beachfront of algae infested waters that are darker green than a forest of trees. I had to walk far to find clean water. The A/C units are cheap and noisy and they don't have a good seal where they're seated in the wall. It is a budget friendly place though. I stayed away from their restaurant based on the reviews. My experience there wasn't horrible like some of the reviews I read, but I can certainly see how it could be. I would probably try here again only because the kids like the pool. I will return to Boracay for a longer stay, but not sure yet if I will stay here. Just feel they can do better.",2,May 2015
"As mentioned by previous reviewers, the wifi is dire. We could only pick it up in the main lobby, and that was touch-and-go at best. We often ended up going to one of the cafes/restaurants along the beach in order to connect to wifi and communicate with our friends at Spider House and Friendz Resort (both of which, by the way, had great wifi).   After a lengthy check-in process, we were happy enough with our room, which had a huge balcony but an extremely noisy A/C unit. We arrived for breakfast the next morning, within the time frame advised by the reception staff, only to discover that we were too late. No problem, though, as there was another restaurant in another building. We walked down there to be told there was no space, and we must return to the original one. We…",1,December 2014
"I depend on my laptop for a living. The hotel said it had Wi-Fi but it only works with cell phones which have a different way of connecting than laptops. Three Wi-fi networks showed up, one open and 2 secured. I could not connect to any with the laptop. I went out to the lobby and saw a girl who was also trying to connect with her laptop and had to give up. I had to do my work outside the hotel. I have my own Globe Tattoo hub which also could could not penetrate their walls.  There are no Table lamps in the room. So the only way to get light is to turn on the overhead lights which I find irritating and annoying.  There are 2 small chairs in the room that are arm less. The seats are wooden slats. So if you want a comfortable seat you are forced to sit on the bed.  The air…",1,May 2015

My stay last year wasn't that smooth, the aircon in our room isn't fractioning well but other than that all was OK so I gave it another chance. That, I really regret!!! We arrived at the hotel nearly 2pm, we haven't ate lunch that time yet so we were already starving. We checked in, put our things in our rooms then looked for a restaurant. When we were eating, my mom asked what kind of room I reserved for them because she didn't like the room they got (I reserved a VIP room for my parents which is according to my booking, located at the main building and beach front and 3 premier rooms for me, my siblings and…",1,May 2015

Just dont expect too much and you'll be ok.. we were supposed to stay on a standard room but we got upgraded to executive deluxe room.. although the room we got is on the back end so no view on the terrace, but we got deluxe room amenities so its a fair deal. we wont be staying much in the room anyway, so why look a for nice window view. my only gripe is that the bathroom is a bit smelly, and ac takes a long time to cool the room.. we had a free breakfast which is just ok.. the staff is also just ok, although they can be busy during peak hours. you can leave your room keys with them if you're going out, which is good if you are in a big group that is not going in the…",3,May 2015
"I have stayed at La Carmela annually since 2007.  It is a budget hotel with budget hotel amenities.  Service has always been good, and actually seems to get better year after year.  This year as I was checking in I mentioned that I was a regular and was told that I would be put int the executive wing.  I thought that would mean an upgrade, not to a room with no windows.  Well we had a tub, and a coffee maker, but behind the curtains there was no window.   The room was as dark as ink.    I had booked two rooms for myself and family and both were without window.  When I asked for another room I was told there were no more available.    I had booked through agoda  - however you book, be sure to specify a room with a window or balcony.",1,May 2015

"We stayed in this hotel for 4d/3n and everything was just so disappointing. They will not change the beddings, towels or clean your room if you don't request them to. The bed sheet is off white when its supposed to be really white. The drinking glass is plastic, room is not well lit and the shower heater in our room doesn't work. In all fairness, the hotel staff is polite. Breakfast buffet consists of sunny side up and scrambled egg, pancit, hotdog, some ulam that is salty, few fruits, pancake and cereal. Food isn't that good.  There was a time that the power went off so the generator automatically started. Our room is so close to it that we're not able to sleep wee hours in the morning. Oh no!",2,May 2015
"La Carmela is the place for you if you want to save on accommodations  in Boracay while still enjoying a beachfront property .  PROS: immediate access to the beach, has a swimming pool as an alternative option for the kids      We availed of the hotel's transfer package from Kalibo - Aklan and vise versa and we have no complaints. The bus was big , spacious and not crowded at all.      The breakfast food is ""blah"" to say the least . It comes free with the room so we decided to use the free breakfast voucher and splurge on lunch and dinner instead. But we sure will not pay extra for this breakfast meal and go somewhere else given the chance .        For our group of 6 adults , 2 kids and one infant we got a loft room which can clearly accommodate more. The loft area is spacious…",3,December 2014

I meet few staff just to ask where is their reception so I can check about my stay on the next day but few of them give me the different direction here and there is really confused for me.and they have No greeting and smile at all.

"We stayed for only a night in this hotel but I have a lot to say already. Bad - free breakfast was awful. It was not appealing and delicious at all. Take breakfast somewhere else. Elevator in the East Wing was inoperative during our stay. Room smelled old though they said it's the newest building. Bed sheets were not as white as it should be. There are like stains that weren't washed properly. Our room doesn't have enough lighting. Though there were four light bulbs in the room, it was still dark. Bathroom door was squeaky noisy! They had so many rules that aren't even the usual hotel rules (no house keeping if guests are not in the room, etc.). Good - they checked us in as early as 9 to 10am without additional fees. Our standard room was upgraded to premier deluxe - also free…",3,April 2015
Ice stayed in the shangrillas and regency and lagoon hotels on boracay. Though the rooms are very basic  i found it one of my most memorable atays on the island. Its a phillipino getaway for the most part. The staff are very good and the fact that your literally just off the beach is a major  asset...the service to the room is a fair..but the food in my opinion was awfull...however ..as my room was  quite cheap  i used the many establishments off the beach to feast. I would go there again And why....the staff were great and as it was filled with mainly philipinos i was surrounded by wonderfull happy souls,3,April 2015

"I have stayed with La Carmela de Boracay for three times as far as I can remember.  All bookings were with a large group as La Carmela offers cheaper promotions for group packages.  We had an office related affair and we were a large group of 62.    What I like about our last booking:      1.  Location, as La Carmela has direct access to the beach front and strategically located between Stations 1 and 3.      2.  Staffs were accommodating and room service was good.  We ordered additional towels and it was delivered in a matter of 5 minutes.      3.  Passable bed  What I do not like:      1.  The food was a gastric catastrophe and I am not exaggerating.  Two of my friends spilled their food out as they had stomach upset.  It felt like eating recycled food.  Our group package came…",2,April 2015

Our accommodation comes with a breakfast, lunch and dinner buffets for three days and we noticed that they were serving recycled food. The food is really bad. Hotel services is not good.  We requested early in the morning for room cleaning and they told us due to the volume of housekeeping requests, room clean up will be scheduled at 5pm. They also have policy that we should be present while they clean the room. Duh? Why hire employees you can't trust? We never got our room cleaned because we have no time to wait for them to clean the room. ",1,April 2015

Our room was big enough for 2 pax.. room/bath/toilet are clean w/towels and some toiletries. Aircon is good. Free buffet breakfast is great. The hotel has free water refilling station for drinking too. Hotel has cash bond of 2000pesos before you can check-in but once you check-out, they will give it back. Free wifi was very slow but it's as they will still allow you to stay at their lounge while waiting for your flight/transfer. ",4,April 2015

"On the positive side : spacious room. I did not have any problems with towels as other tripadvisor contributors. Next to the beach, but can be reached with your vehicle. I could enter the room early with no charge. On the negative side : the flyer with the explanation how to use the safe is not correct at all. The aircon seems to have problems keeping the room extra cool. Breakfast could be more tasty and is not very warm. Conclusion not bad for the price and location.",3,April 2015
aside from the hotel is affordable i can sy that the money u pay is worthy. my package includes 3 days 2 nights accomodation in la carmela i stayed in the east wing that was a quiet one if you like privacy and the service of the hotel is so nice. when i called the frontdesk for some services like to bring water etcc they immediately response its a matter of being good communicator thats why i never encounter any probs especially when they call for my land transfer they even assist me for that. they are hands on even for the transfers of clients to their corresponding company just like mine island star express. thanks to traveldotcom it was a nice deal,5,April 2015

We were going to stay here a lot of nights but we checked out earlier after 4 days. We arrived early in the morning and was told to come back at 2 pm because our room was not ready. It was ok but when we came back at 2 pm the receptionist was not sure our room was ready and has to check. After several minutes she told us that a room was ready for us and that we were upgraded to a better room, free of charge.

For exampel; They don´t clean your room and if you want your room clean you had to call the reception and they MAY clean your room,…",1,March 2015
"Though there were cheaper hotels nearby, we still chose La Carmela for having better facilities. If you're tired of going to the beach, you can also take the creative designed swimming pool. The building was good and the staffs were very accommodating. When we arrived, it was a whole day brownout but then the hotel was able to provide generator produced electricity for the entire day. The only problem we encountered was the busted sink and low water pressure. I don't know if low water pressure really happens in the entire island or it might be because we were staying at the 4th floor.",4,January 2015

Nice clean room, clean toilet, hot shower working fine, soap, shampoo etc are provided. Why did i give only 4 rating? Because of the buffet breakfast.

However the 2 beds came in handy when we had the awesome and cheap in room swedish massage that we had every night!!!!!

And the breakfast wasn't the best. I would've wished for more continental buffé. The rooms all in all needs a renovation. And the first thing they asked us was if we wanted to upgrade our room because they were building on a new property across the street.

So, if you come to Boracay for some peace and quiet, go somewhere else.   Our accommodation was basic. Nothing fancy for such a rate. The thing with La Carmela is it can be really crowded that guests outnumber the staff - big time. I don't remember during our stay (no matter how short that was) of any housekeeping staff to check on us. We did get a welcome drink and escorted to our room. Other than that, nothing. Staff (if we ever saw one) would just pass by and move along.

The unwelcoming signs followed us to the breakfast table where they again warn you about fines if you don't eat all your food. While I don't condone the wasting of food, at this point I was wondering whether I was actually on holiday in a hotel in a beautiful tropical island or was I some how transported back in time to a nazi camp in auzwich.

Service wise average but greeting the guests should be a habit of employees and should be learned by the OJTs.

Also wifi access is limited only to restaurant areas and even so its so difficult to get connection. Their in-house policy is quiet strict. U need to sign a waiver if u want ur room cleaned while you are away or else they wont clean your room.  No cups/glasses in the room. It has to be requested.

Location is just near the beach which I really love. Staffs are attentive and polite. Room is clean.  Towels are old and look dirty though. My buffet experienced wasn't great.

Clean Room - We got a pretty decent room (Room 148 - Quad Sharing). Air-conditioning is good. No glasses, no water heater and old towels. But if we lower down our expectations, this is still good. They replaced towels the next day and can always request for room cleaning.   3. Food - Breakfast buffet is okay. Definitely not as great as the other hotels but again, we just need to manage our expectations. After all, food is not their forte.

If your looking for a magnificent view than this IS NOT the hotel for you, but the beach is just a minute walk from the hotel. The only complaint I had while staying there (three nights) was that there was no hot water to shower. The first night the water was not even luke warm and the following two nights it was only cold!

"The hotel seems so ambitious with expansion as evidenced by huge buildings built. But customer service is awful. Let me count their failures:  1. They do not provide you basic things inside the room such as glasses or mugs. 2. Waiting for someone to clean your room seems forever because there are plenty of rooms and not enough people to do housekeeping. 3. The room we were in was like an improved prison cell. It had no wifi and mobile phone signal so when there is an emergency from home, you wouldnt know what happened until you wake up and get out of the hotel building to call your family. 4.

The shower is terrible water  very slow i use the tap to wash my hair there is no hot or cold shower its only either very hot or cold shower. 2. There is a fine on everything. They have list of items in the room from painting to toilet sit . Half of the listed items we realy dont have in the room (we had a premier deluxe) so i told the reception that we dont have like kettle glass cup etc and she told me that "" we dont really have everything on the list in the room "" ???

"We stayed in this hotel last January 5-7, 2015. We occupied rm 209 at west building. To be honest, I was not really impressed.  Room- the space was ok and the room was clean. The room has 2 beds with 2 pillows each, old towels (only 2 bath towels and 1 hand towel), safe box, tv and coffee table. In the washroom, there were 2 soaps and 2 shampoo. I was expecting to have glasses in the washroom, basic toiletries and slippers. There was no hair dryer accdg from their rules. The hotel was aware (in advance) that 3 people are staying in the room but not enough towels were available.   Foods/ room service- our hotel stay included breakfast. The foods served in the buffet were not delicious at all and there were no fresh fruits (they served fruit cocktails- from the can). On our first…",2,January 2015
"Good:  1. Pleasant staff. Needs more professional customer service training, but they do try their best to be pleasant.   2. Check out is 11am, but they will let you extend until 12nn. And provide a room for luggage, to store your stuff after check out.  3. Firm bed and good pillows 4. Beachfront location 5. Beautiful beach view while having breakfast   Bad:  1. Bad breakfast buffet. You will pay an extra P270/person for breakfast, after two guests (per room). Main dishes are from leftovers. I informed one server they were out of misua soup, he replied, ""That's it, ma'am. We do not replenish."" Another server interrupted and said, ""We still have ulam and misua, from the convention"" and brought out a whole pot of room temperature soup.

We were suppose to stay at the main bldg which was nearer to the beach but instead they told us that we would be given an ""upgrade room"" which was in the east wing bldg, later did we find out that the bldg was further away from the beach than the one we originally booked, and the east wing's elevator was under maintenance. The room was ok, they do not have any complementary bottled water, instead they had a water dispenser down the hall. The bathroom's shower and toilet division had a gaping hole which was pretty stupid. Every time you took a shower the whole bathroom floor would get wet. The sink and shower lacked places to put toiletries. The hot water shower was hard to control, there were times the water would just suddenly get cold. The door in one of…",3,January 2015

Im a hotelier so I definitely know what an incidental deposit mean and its purpose.   FOOD- Our rooms come with free buffet breakfast and each table in the restaurant has a note,""we charge double for leftovers"" and the waitstaff even informed me this when I have 2 kids with me.

"We’ve stayed in The La Carmela De Boracay last January 2-5, 2015.  It was such a nice place but not that great. I‘ll give it a 4 star rating. The good thing about this place is that, it is so affordable and clean. With its beach front, I was in awe with their good rates having a pool facing the beach and just some steps away from the beach and a buffet breakfast included in their package.  If you are looking for a great place to stay, this is not your place but if you are looking for a budget friendly and a good night sleep kinda place, I recommend this one.  Clean rooms, clean surroundings and well maintained building but the inside is a little bit old especially their room doors, needs maintenance. Their staff is so friendly and accommodating.  As far as safety and security is…",4,January 2015

"I looked at Trip Advisor as well as the hotel website for pictures, and all of them were very misleading.  I paid for wifi, which had very poor connectivity. It took ages to load websites, and it took me LITERALLY four hours to book plane tickets.  I was given three keys for the room (because originally there were three of us staying) but only one of them worked.  The information guide says you can borrow towels anytime, but when my boyfriend and I went down to get some, they had run out. So we couldn't even go swimming in the pool.  **ALSO, NO hot water, NO clean water, and NO water provided in the room - what kind of hotel doesn't provide the bare essentials?**  The best part of the hotel is that you can step outside, and the beach is right there.

They organised our transfers, which is the only part I had to pay in cash since it was done over the phone. As soon as we get in to oir rooms, swarms of mosquitoes welcomed us. Bath plug was damaged and is corroding. After a bath the water was not draining as the plug is stuck. We reported this immediately when we went out for lunch, and to my dismay I have been passed on from one reception to the other.

Not Suprised by the ""Welcome to La Carmela, I have to read you our rules"".  Not the warmest of welcomes but look at the funny side and took it lightheartedly . Reception has the feel on an airport departure lounge. No WiFi in the rooms so people crowding in reception to connect. Our room was fine. Quite large, towels okay, free use of safe, adequate toiletries but why no glasses in the bathroom? Several comments here about it. How much is a couple of plastic cups going to set you back? Confused by the room cleaning policy. They only clean rooms on request and then will only do so with the guest present. I've never come across this before and wondered…",3,January 2015

"Well, where do I start? The hotel looks nice from the outside and the inside. From our booking, it was evident that La Carmela couldn't get the basics right. We booked 4 rooms and was approved only to be told the next day that they couldn't accommodate us. So we settled for 2 rooms with the rest of our group stayed at Isla Gecko (should have stayed there instead - although not advisable if you have to use the lift as they do not have one). Saying that, La Carmela's was broken for the 3 days that we were there. The basics here of hotel keeping is not being followed. They do not change your towels, your bed sheets and they do not supply any toilet rolls apart from the ones you already have in your room - for the entire 3 days that we were there! The breakfast was awful, they…",1,January 2015
"I could have given this the lowest rating (terrible) had it not  been for the receptionists who truly showed great customer service.  After check-in, a scary elevator will greet you which obviously needed an upgrade or maintenance. The hallways will give you the feeling that you're walking in a cheap hospital - and you can hear the conversations of guests inside the room.  Spiders! If you're afraid of big bugs, stay away from this hotel. In my first night, I was digging through my baggage when a big local spider (around 4-5 inches total leg span) suddenly crawled from the rack where you're supposed to put your dirty laundry!

Broke a key in the hotel inside the lock was replaced free  The ugly  1. Deposit in cash only?  2. Printed booking only don't want to accept digital but finally agreed its 2014! 3. Horrible check in process as I mentioned should be digital 4. Not allowed to drink your own alcohol or beer by pool only if you buy at their bar 5. Buffet food boring and plain always Filipino food should have more western dishes.,3,December 2014
"My family and I stayed there for 3 nights last June 1, 2014. I always saw Filipino actors endorsing it especially Boy Abunda that's why I booked a room there for the first time as I always go to Boracay and never stayed with them. The room is very hot, we tried complaining but no one even bothered to get back to us. When I went to the front desk, the agent told me that they can't do anything about it because all the rooms have the same aircon size which is 3/4s. Seems like their engineering department did not advice their purchasing department to get an aircon which suits the size of the room that's why no matter how you put your thermostat in highest temperature, it will still be warm in the room and you can't relax or can't sleep in a hot room.",1,June 2014
"Stayed at this hotel after Christmas. The hotel was teeming with  guests. I guess the hotel's promo department was good at booking guests and tour packages.  Hotel rate was reasonable. First impression was that they had old towels and that  no housekeeping done in the two days that we were there.  Breakfast was free and food fare was not so palatable.  No glasses inside the room but there is service water  in every corridor.   Despite that, my kids liked the place because it is so near the beach and the hotel has a pool. They just have to get rid of those old old towels in the rooms. Boy Abunda surely won't like seeing  old towels in the hotel he is promoting.",3,December 2014
I booked 5 rooms in this hotel. The first 2 rooms were checked in straight away before 12pm while the last 3 rooms were checked in after lunch which is ok. Upon arrival you can already see the overcrowded guests waiting for their rooms.  We were given welcome drinks but upon request.  Lift was not working so we have to use the stairs.  One of the rooms that we booked had a hole in the window.  We made a complaint after checking the room but no action was done until a rat went inside the room and told the staff that it was unacceptable. Front desk solution was to send their staff in the room and kill the rat. We have to put our foot down that the room is under maintenance and should not be occupied. We were given an upgrade but a lot of hassle.  Complimentary brekkie  Their…,2,January 2015

This and the transfers was the only good part of our stay in this resort. Thanks for the refund.  They fine you for everything. Notices all over the resort on various fines and other rules and regulation. Almost like a prison. Rooms are very basic. No WIFI, housekeeping, water or glasses in the rooms.  Pathetic soap quality and no other toiletries.  The rooms have no view at all.   Had only breakfast and what a mess. It is a stampede to get in, get a table and help yourself. Overall quality is below average.  Would rate this resort poor and would not recommend.",2,December 2014

Breakfast is so obvious that buffet table is running out of food yet no one seems to care. And one more thing, says wifi free only in cafe & resto.

Long wait to check in and out and they have some weird thing were yo have to present your checkout receipt to the security guard before you can be let out the hotel – even though we had pre-paid. I guess it speaks a lot about their guests.  We won’t we visiting again!",2,January 2015

Elevators were ""temporarily"" out of orders during our stay but I am starting to wonder if they didn't only buy the shell and are not even thinking of buying the rest of it. The staff don't do the rooms if you don't ask them. No water pressure watsoever and the temperature of the water changes to super hot to cold without any reason. The WIFI is weak and you will need to pay 100 Pesos for one hour which is a joke in 2014. The towels are all old and broken and the worst of all: the rooms are not soundproof at all.

"First off, the elevator is out of order. So we have to climb the stairs to our third floor room. Not that big a deal but for 'modern' hotel, it should be working. Next there is no gym.

I haven't  stayed in a hotel in over 20 years that didn't have WiFi in the rooms. If even you have to pay for it. If had known all this BEFORE we booked the room,we wouldn't be staying here.

It isn't beachfront exactly, but a short walk to the beach. Being a reasonably priced hotel, it is popular among visitors and is almost fully booked during peak season.

Buffet breakfast is good. Pork, chicken, beef dishes. Pancakes, bread, soup, cereals and congee are serve as well. But be very observant, 2 mornings in a row, I saw flies on their cereals and fruit cocktails!!!  Standard room is not so good.…",2,November 2014
"Stayed in a standard room for 4 persons. 4D3N. Nov 2014  Rooms - The rooms are clean but lacks of door mats especially in the bathroom. So when you take a shower, it will flood your bathroom and your room when you didn't dry yourself well - Aircon is noisy - Our electronic safe is not working. - TV remote is not working. They didn't checked and replaced the batteries. - Waited about 1 hour for housekeeping. - Rooms looks cozy even the cheapest rooms - No hotel food and drinks menu for room service  Bathroom - There's hot water but the sink's water pressure is low. - Smelly bathroom.

"Been to the paradise island of Boracay countless times and it feels like always the first time! Staying at La Carmela de Boracay makes it all worth it! Room rates are very affordable yet service's excellent! Staff's accomodating, very clean soroundings and safe to stay is what i always see to it when i check on to hotels to stay on. But what amazed me was their free breakfast buffet- perfect for anybody's taste buds! An array of breakfast menus served from 6am-8am all unlimitted eat all you can! Ilove that part and it brings you excitement when you wake up in the morning at La Carmela de Boracay knowing a fiesta breakfast awaits!  My next visit to the island? I surely would book in at LA CARMELA DE BORACAY Hotel just the same.",5,November 2014
"This resort is very popular because of celebrity endorsements and most tv shows also shoot here. I booked my stay here because it seemed convenient. They had this barkada package in which you get full board accommodations, 3x a day meals, room accommodation and airport transfer for a reasonable fee. Plus kudos to their reservations officer (Brendo) for replying to all my emails promptly with all the info I needed. So here's how my stay went.  Upon arrival at Kalibo, Island Star express was already there to pick us up. Big bus, spacious. Not a lot of people inside the bus. 2 hour ride from Kalibo to Caticlan. La Carmela has its own port and own boat which brought us to the island, 10 minute ride. Then a van brought us to La Carmela.  I also chose La Carmela because it was…",3,November 2014
"Ok, me and my partner stayed here for 9nights. There are pros and cons about this place. More cons than pros though.  First impression was average. You pay for what you get I guess. This place was cheap. We paid just over 300 british pounds for the 9 nights  including breakfast in the executive wing.   The rooms were ok, 2 double beds fridge tv with movie channels a bathroom with bath and shower and a safe. All in all average. We had a balcony, which was small. With table and chairs, and it looked to be a old pool I assume  between them both, which you couldn't use, it had no water in there, just a small amount of dirty rain water so it wasn't a pretty site. You couldn't really go out there as the air con was leaking water which left it all wet,  apart from that the air con…",2,November 2014
Stayed on the back of top bid in a charity auction and would not go back on any account. Inclusive breakfast was well below what my wife & I deem acceptable; room was dirty (cobwebs in accessible areas); fridge didn't work and was very dirty around the door seal; a/c very noisy meaning bad nights' sleep - you either leave it on and cannot sleep due to the noise or you switch it off and cannot sleep due to the heat. Very slight redeeming features were the shower that worked OK & proximity to the beach. Other collateral benefit was that we felt forced to spend most of the time out of the hotel & duly found good places to eat. Not for me to tell people where to stay but my wife & I wouldn't go back to La Carmela even if we were paid to.,1,October 2014
"Not happy with this hotel we stay here with friends and family after my wedding in batangas. We did not enjoy our stay in this hotel at all, rooms are very basic, service is so bad it takes 1 hour to give you toilet paper and fresh towels. There is long waits during breakfast not enough space to accomodate everyone. It's so noisy, the hotel looks nice outside but not inside. The only thing I like in this hotel is the location it is close to beach, shops etc. ",1,April 2014
"This hotel is so noisy, a real echo chamber. Very crowded. Room cleaning only every second day, & only by request. Guest must be present during cleaning, otherwise forced to sign a waiver releasing hotel of responsibility for your possessions. Terrible WiFi connection only in lobby, must pay for in room, & still just barely connection. Breakfast terrible, not enough seats, a madhouse. I ended up dining outside. Upon checking in room, batteries in safe were dead, replaced & one week later dead again, couldn't open safe. Air-conditioner noisy, & stopped working, had to be replaced.",1,October 2014
"I think the problem with this hotel is that it doesn't seem to understand how to handle the volume of guests that they get. I get that it's a budget hotel and that one shouldn't expect much. I've stayed here twice (Oct '13 and Oct '14)  The first time I stayed here (Oct '13) was with a big group so I didn't really have to deal with staff.   We decided to stay at this hotel (Oct '14) because we landed in the island at about 9pm at night and didn't want to spend a full day at another hotel. We got it so that we would have a basic place to sleep in that night.  We stayed in the newer wing, which has A LOT of rooms per floor. Room is decent enough for what you pay.

"Okay, this hotel has sooooo many rooms We had this small room that was included in our package. We decided to upgrade it to much more beachfront because the small room is close to a renovating site. Drilling and hammering sound is annoying.  We moved to celebrity suit japanese style.  It was awsome.  We stayed for a good 5 nights. Costs 11,000 pesos a night. But this room is huge. Probably fit 7-9 people. It has 2 bathroom. 3 aircon and 2 tv with dvd player.  Cons about this room  Close to a karaoke bar that we can hear from our room.

"We recently stayed at la carmela after reading some positive reviews. We booked for two nights in a deluxe room with sea view. We recieved and twin double room with a view of nothing other than the building next door ( about 1.5metres away form our balcony). Air conditioning was so loud even on the lowest setting we couldn't get a good nights sleep, the key for the door took what felt like a lifetime to gain access to the room, the main reception staff were incredibly unhelpful - especially when confronted about our reserved reservation being totally ignored.

"We had no closet in our room, just a few hangers for our clothes. We weren't able to borrow a flat iron, because they don't lend one. So I walked around Boracay wearing wrinkled clothes.  Something was terribly wrong with the shower drain. It smelled really pukey each time we bathed! I also wasn't able to eat anything from the breakfast buffet, because they didn't have a single fresh fruit/veg option.   It was just okay. Our room rate was 2,400 PhP/night. Not that expensive, but I still don't think it was worth it. The staff was nice though, and the location was convenient. Just don't pass at the back of the hotel going to the main road.

The room was fine - better than I expected considering the reviews but that being said. we stayed in the Panorama Room in the Executive Wing. The bathroom was small but fine enough. The shower was good but the sink was horrible, if you put the tap on too much the water would spray everywhere so when washing your hands, brushing your teeth etc, you had to have it on a very low water pressure.  Some parts of the hotel had a horrible smell when walking past which was very unpleasant. The breakfast wasn't that bad (not my first choice though)...it was just very busy so try arrive early if you can/want.

Hotel is beachfront, with two outdoor pools, room at ground floor level especially near restaurant/breakfast area can get very noisy. Attentive and efficient staff especially helping with guests luggage and during buffet breakfast. Which I really appreciate because you don't need to call their attention to help us with our luggage during check-in/check out time. I also notice during breakfast that tables are being cleared right away after guest are done eating and food are being replenished timely.

"La Carmela de Boracay is popular to budget travelers like me. It is the best economical hotel in the whole of this beach paradise.   It is not bad for me since I am a solo traveler and I just need a room to store my things and a place to rest my tired body from all the water sport activities and all-night of partying.   Anyway, the hotel is truly a low-cost hotel. The room was plain and simple nothing spectacular but it is clean. The hotel has long tiring hallways. Not really good if you had so much drinks. The toilet and bath was as basic as the room.  The employees were warmy, polite, friendly and accommodating, a true example of Filipino hospitality.   Internet facilities were just limited to some common areas like the lobby and the dining area.  Free breakfast was relatively…",3,April 2014
"If you're going to Boracay to enjoy the beach, activities and the nightlife (in short, staying mostly out of the hotel), then I would recommend this place.  The price is okay, affordable especially if you're travelling with a group of friends. The location is good; beachfront. But it's located at the end of Station 2, border of station 3. So if you prefer short distance walks to restaurants near ""Talipapa"" or ""D'mall"", then you better choose another. My friends and I enjoyed the walks because there were lots to see, so it wasn't really a big deal for us.  Service was good. Staff were helpful and courteous.

We are booked in a different hotel, and since we avail the service of island star for hotel transport, we stop by la carmela to drop off guests in that hotel. Now as we arrive in our hotel, i realized my luggage is missing, so in an effort to look for it, we went back to la carmela. The hotel staff assisted us in reviewing the cctv footage and thank God they were able to trace back my luggage as one of the newly arrived guest took it by mistake.

You just need to go there really early or almost late to avoid lines. They have a pool which is a good idea if the waves are too big for you to swim. They are far away from the bar, which is a plus for us since we are not really the party-goer type of people.",3,June 2014

The bathroom has a bathtub but my friend got grounded in there so we had to switch to another room. The service is great and all our demands/queries are being attended to. The only hassle is the long wait in the check-in/check-out counter. With such a big hotel, their lobby should be upgraded in order to cater the high number of guests.

"Stayed here for 3 days and 2 nights. Good hotel to stay if your on a budget. Family friendly especially at night because it's far from the noisy ""clubs"" of station 1.  The Wifi was very poor.. though, even the paid one. Bed sheets were old and dirty white. Buffet breakfast was good. The staff were friendly and very accomodating. ",3,July 2014
"As we had an early flight we had to wait for our room 6hrs, then we was allocated on a high floor yet there is no view at all except where the housekeeping hang their wash bed sheets.  Breakfast food is alright. Staff are really friendly though & always helpful. Great location, next to the beach, hotel is between station 1 & 3 couldn't ask for more on location.",4,May 2014
"We booked an executive deluxe room with them through a popular online hotel reservation site and got a good deal.  The room has its own semi private (as it is shared with the adjacent room) pool but it was not filled with water. We did not bother to ask the staff to fill it up since we won't be using it anyway. The room also has a balcony although the view is the next building.  Room is okay and can accommodate only up to four or else it can get crowded.  They did not provide bottles of drinking water though as what you would normally find in other hotels.  The bathroom has a tub and hot and cold shower. Although we stayed here for 3 nights the bathroom supplies - tissue, soap, shampoo were not replenished. The towels were not also changed. The room was not cleaned as it is…",3,July 2014
La Carmela boracay is located in station 2 and a beachfront.if you are on a tight budget then this is a best place for you..of course don't expect a lot from this hotel! Room-nothing much special.furnitures are not luxurious! Food-a lot of viands to choice Service-excellent staff and attentive.Iam very much satisfied with the service of pick up and drop off from airport!  Pool-very small and no privacy!  This hotel is very crowded during Holy Week!  ,3,April 2014
"We stayed here for 3 night, the room was good for it's price. We are not very particular with the room as long as it's clean since most of the time we will be out.

Power outlet was loose, we're charging of mobile phone and noticed it late that it's not charging due to loose outlet. We moved to other outlet but still the same.  FOOD and BUFFET  1. Breakfast buffet is good, sometime they run out of spoon and fork even plate! 2. We ate buffet dinner since it's raining, Mongolian seems to be not cooked very well (I can say it not being cooked or just been heated) the squid balls is raw, the tomatoes that I put still sticks with each other, meaning it's not being mix properly.  Attentive staffs, great…",3,July 2014
This is the second time that I stayed in La Carmela. The first one was with my husband and our daughter in 2011. We had no issues with the room probably because we stayed in the executive wing. The only minus point then was the breakfast which is really terrible and the hallway which is very dark...  This time I went there together with my office mates. We were given 3 rooms in the 4th floor of the old building. Our group stayed in room 432 and the first night was really terrible. The aircon because of its size could not cool the room. I was up all night fanning myself. We couldn't sleep because of the heat (this was in June-almost end of summer...imagine how it was in April and May ...ouch!). We went to the reception to request for a change... it took them quite sometime to…,2,June 2014
"We got a free upgrade from a Family Room to a VIP room since our room wasn't ready yet when we checked in. It is a multilevel room with 1 twin bed, 3 king size beds, 2 full bathrooms, 2 mini fridge, and a balcony. We were given complimentary breakfast during our 2 days stay. The staff are polite and accommodating. I am rating La Carmela as average because of a few inconveniences - the a/c on the 2nd level wasn't functioning properly and it is disappointing that the semi-private mini pool wasn't working as well. The complimentary coffee and sugar packets was also infested with ants but the housekeeping crew came right away to clean it. La Carmela is strategically located at Station 3 with many outdoor activities to choose from. We had a good stay but we will check out other…",3,May 2014
"The hotel is a beachfront hotel in station 2 so it is ideal for for those who would like to be in the middle of all the happenings in the White Beach area and the island. Its location is the main reason why we chose the resort. The room that we stayed in had all the things that we needed except free Wi-Fi (which is offered with a fee). Compared to the other beachfront hotels in the area, I believe that it's one of the cheapest, but it's not also very cheap. It's just right or appropriate in terms of location and amenities present. However, given the room rate per day, I believe that free Wi-Fi should be included. The staff were attentive and courteous. We planned this trip to celebrate my father's birthday, so we surprised him with a small chocolate cake on the day of his…",3,June 2014
"La Carmela is conveniently located at the station 3 beachfront.  Though some of the staff are friendly but training in service oriented business needs a lot of improvement.  Room is very small, not even a glass or a cup was not readily available inside the room,  you need to ask for them to give.  Basic thing like hot water flask and hair dyer not even provided.  Breakfast is very poor.  You need to fire your chef!!!!! Its totally non appetising and no taste.  One new crew even spray dettol in our table because she saw a stain while we are still eating. Pissed off that time. Toilet is also averagely clean.  You cannot enjoy showering because water pressure is very poor. Overall, i can't recommend this hotel.",2,February 2014
"Though the place is a little bit crowded ( we booked timely during a convention when the place was exclusively use by delegates ) but  cost wise  it is very affordable. The location at Station 2 is perfect too. The shore is just a stone throw away.   I love swimming in a pool, but I dislike their pool's location which is in front the hotel , along the road. over-all the place is nice.",4,January 2014
"Cockroaches inside our bathroom is so big. I got really scared! Stayed at room A6 on June 17-19, 2014. Worst breakfast buffet. The place where to eat breakfast smells awful and the food is gross. There's even cockroach on it! We called the attention of the waiter to report the issue but he didn't even went back for us. I just don't want to waste time arguing with the staff because it's our first time to Boracay! Never ever gonna stay here again. Such a nightmare!",1,June 2014
"Okay. So, I am writing this as an American, not a Filipino. So a Filipino, this might be very average or possibly considered like a budget hotel. To me however, this was definitely lower than a Motel 6. I am just giving my perspective. You see beautiful pictures online, making you feel like this is some 4 star resort. It's super crowded, tons of kids running around, the buffet is chaos, the AC barely works, they are super stingy with towels and toilet paper, there is no fridge or amenities in the room, and they do not clean your room. We stayed almost a week and it was never cleaned, even when requested once.  I will say that the buffet is nice, but oh dear Lord! Crowded. The close proximity of the beach is excellent, and it's right next to the tourist center, I will give it…",2,April 2014
"Stayed there for 4D 3N for a seminar.  Room: It was a bit old and sad. Yup. Sad. Hehe. We stayed in Room 151. It was at the end of the corridor. It was really dark. The bed was nice though. And the CR is clean. But I expected something better from such a big and famous hotel.  Function Room: Really crowded. Probably not their fault because the organizers didn't expect such a big turnabout of participants.  Food: We were booked for buffet breakfast lunch and dinner. Understandably, it's really difficult to serve buffets.  They lacked variety.  We were calling the food: Chopsuey de Lunes, de Martes, Afritada de Lunes, de Miyerkules, etc. Thumbs down.",3,June 2014
"La Carmela de Boracay is a budget hotel. Don't expect much.  We booked here for 2 nights. We're a family of 3 adults. We got 2 twin executive deluxe rooms (located at the executive wing). There's no ocean view in these rooms.  Positive: 1. The hotel is beachfront. You can access the beach right away. If you'll book a room at the main building instead of the executive wing, you'll be nearer to the beach.  2. They have a swimming pool near the beach. This is good for kids and for those who don't like to swim in the sea.   3. No problem with the A/C.    Negative: 1. Expect a bumpy ride if you'll ride a tricycle as you get to the hotel's small street (eskenita). It is because the street is incomplete. I hope they fix this. We were told that it rained last night and so the street was…",2,June 2014
"We stayed in La Carmela twice already. I normally chose them because its affordable, has good location and withpool along beach front. Most of the resort hotels with pool there were expensive especially facing beach front. My toddler loves to play in the pool and then after on beach.   Room was clean with bathroom amenities and hotel staff were courteous.   Location near to restaurants & D'Mall, but little far from station one.   Breakfast was ok, we were upgraded to buffet instead of set meal that time, since they were fully booked.   Only thing is that our room was located in their annex building... that it will take sometime to go up on our room... but that was fine.   I will definite choose again this hotel on our 3rd boracay trip on Feb.   Thank you",4,January 2014
"The food is not good at this hotel. We had to eat at beachside restaurants to taste good food. So we needed to spend more money just to eat good food. People go on vacation to enjoy, so I guess we should treat tourists with good food so they could enjoy. The rooms were good but aircon and water heater maintenance is needed.",2,June 2014
"Beachfront location. The front desk was thorough in explaining the house rules, Limited choices with their complimentary breakfast, the menu has no variety at all, and the taste of the food can be improved as well. You can hear noises outside your room from hallways. Rooms and bathrooms ok, You cant have to much expectations for the money you pay, but just remember you only sleep in the room, all the activities happens outside which was a great fun example helmet diving.",3,April 2014
"Nice family resort, marred by a number of flaws during our stay at the new wing.  - The lobby was very badly ventilated: they did not even bother to install fans. - At check in, we were read a long list of rules, such as full payment is due even if stay is cancelled, etc. The rules give the impression of a penny pinching management. - The rules mentioned that towels are changed only upon request, which is fine with me. However, when we reached the room, there were no towels at all. - To get the towels, I tried to call housekeeping. To no avail. The laminated instruction sheet mentioned 3 numbers. I tried all 3 as well as in combination with common prefixes of 0 or 9. Did not work. Met housekeeping staff by chance and was told the prefix was 3. I tried that and got a room…",3,June 2014
"Just a basic place to sleep at if you won't get the high end rooms. Food is not good but if you get the free breakfast buffet that comes with the accommodation, it's filling enough and allows you to save money by not going out to eat.  They have a nice pool. Although it can get crowded. One thing I like about this place is their Peak and Off Peak Season are different from other hotels in Boracay. Meaning you could be paying peak rate at another hotel but off peak rate at La Carmela, on the same date. Best to check their website.  When on a budget, La Carmela would be good enough. Considering their location. But if you can splurge a bit, you might wanna skip this hotel.",3,July 2013
"Been there last March 18-20, 2014 with all the employees in my company. We booked through an agency and they offer the cheapest rates for group. We didn't stay much at the resort because we are so busy doing adventures in the island, so we hardly had time to enjoy the amenities of the hotel. It is best for groups or couple travelling on a budget.",4,March 2014
"My friend and I spent 5 nights at La  Carmela and I can safely say I have not stayed somewhere worse for a long, long time. Where to start... the room was super spartan. There was not even a directory with the number to dial for reception. All that was left on the bedside table was an exhaustive list of house rules and an an equally exhaustive list setting out how much you would be charged if any of those items were broken. The towels were old and had seen better days. The bathroom came with no bath mat and the tap at the sink rendered do little water one had to wash their hands under the shower. Needed to be careful though. The shower drained at an excruciatingly slow pace.   Only on arrival were we told our room could only be serviced by appointment, and in our presence.…",1,June 2014
"Upon arrival, welcome drinks are served by the friendly staff. The over-all look of the hotel looks commercialized. It was greatly packed with rooms so that the hotel can accomodate a lot of guests. The room we got was in the Premier Wing. It got two beds, a table, a small tv. The room got no view of the beach at all. But it was okay for us, since most of the time, we were out in the sun or doing beach activities. The location was good as it is very near the beach. It is between station 2 and station 3. Most of the places we went to eat were in station 1 though. So we needed to walk a few distance but we don't mind walking in sandy white beach. Over-all, we had a good stay in this hotel. Would I come back? If I have no other option left within the same price range, I guess I…",3,March 2014

The front desk was thorough in explaining the house rules, it only did not go well when we learned that the elevator was not working and our room is at the 4th floor, the elevator functioned only on our 3rd day, well it was quite disappointing as we were tired and was traveling the whole day to get to the island. They only had very limited choices with their complimentary breakfast, the menu has no variety at all, and the taste of the food can be improved as well.

They were prompt to go to your room if asked for room cleaning. The room was also clean. Clean bed sheets and towels. The only downside is that there was dirt (small particles) in the toilet sink. I am not sure if it fell from the ceiling. But it can be rid by cleaning with water.",3,April 2014
My family and I enjoyed our stay here last April 2014. We stayed at a family room in the executive wing and which included the daily buffet breakfast for 6 days. It's definitely not shang ri la or discovery shores but it's worth what we paid for. My 12 year old nephew enjoyed the breakfast buffet especially the soup and my 4 year old niece loved both the swimming pools. I also loved sunbathing at the beachfront. The staff were always happy and courteous and were always ready to help. The room massage we had was really good and one of the more affordable rates in Boracay. The only downside were the brownouts which made the only elevator in the building useless...I would definitely stay here again.,3,April 2014

"This is one of the worst hotels I've stayed at for a long time.  Check-in took a long time, very disorganised staff followed by a 15 minute 'rant' about the house rules and that you couldn't do this and couldn't do that!!  Not very welcoming especially after a very long flight from Australia.    The room was just okay.  Uncomfortable bed, the electricity kept cutting out (probably 3 times each afternoon) and the shower was merely more than a drip (forget about hot water).  The cleaners are not allowed into your room when you are not there - so my room never got cleaned whilst I was there.  I even had to go down to reception to ask for toilet paper - of which I received attitude from the staff.   Breakfast was past disgusting and the queues were long for some rice and/or…",1,May 2014

Checked out after the first night and transferred to another hotel.   Location is okay. Yes, beachfront but most of the rooms are located far away from the beach.   The room assigned was at the first level of the main wing far away from the beach. Room cleanliness must be improved.

We stayed for 3D 2N and I was with my wife and 2 kids. The hotel wasn't extraordinary although it's not really bad. Food isn't great but reasonable price. Long walk to the beach from inside the hotel. Didn't like the terrace view from where we stayed because you'll just see small buildings and people walking and not so much of nature.,3,June 2013
"We stayed here for 4D3N during Labor Day Weekend (April30-May3). Never thought all hotels would be sold out, so we had to stay here. Not that I hate this place, but it's probably a one time thing. Knowing clear that it was a budget hotel, I knew I should not compare the services I get with high-star hotels. I try to be fair with my reviews... We got the Premiere Rooms 306 and 308 at the new wing building which was a 2-3min walk to the beach. If you get these rooms or would be located at the New Wing, you'd be at the other far end side of the hotel, not in the beachfront.  Room- The feel of the room was unwelcoming.

Around 2mins to the beach, food outlets and pubs. 7mins to d'mall and the main party on the beach. Room rates were cheap considering breakfast was included.   Now for what I didn't like about this place. Firstly, the road along the entrance to the hotel lobbies were constantly flooded due to the construction going on next door. This also caused the hotel to be infested with Mosquitos. When we asked the hotel staff for spray or mosquito coils, they said they would return with spray but never did.

When I returned my room was marginally cleaner but I had been robbed, my watch, sunglasses and earings taken from my luggage.  I reported this to the front desk who seemed very unconcerned.  This is obviously a common occurrence at this hotel.    The breakfast was also awful and there was nowhere near enough to feed the large number of guests dining at the buffet.

The loft option was great because it gave my husband and I some privacy even though we were sharing the room with my in-laws.

"Stayed here in October 2013 having attended a family wedding in Cagayan de Oro, flew to Iloilo and got a taxi to the port to get to Boracay, next time would probably fly rather than taxi - we flew back from Kalibo to Manila. Anyways booked this hotel as our extended stay had us on a budget. We got a great deal online and initially booked in for a couple of nights as we were apprehensive of the cheap price!  We found the rooms clean and comfortable with good bathroom, it's a pity there's not more light in the rooms as I found them quite dark- not that we spent too much time in the room! Great location on the beach and plenty of bars and restaurants nearby ! Didn't eat in the hotel but had drinks and juices and these were very good value compared to some of the bars around.  Free…",4,October 2013
"It's my third time in Boracay and 2nd time in this hotel. Location is front of beach. We were 4 in the room (main bldg.),complimentary breakfast was only good for 2. Towels are provided but old. Bedsheets are clean,but looks dark. Bathroom was worn out. Safety locker is provided in room. Need to inform reception to fix room every day as per policy. Deposit of 2,000 pesos is required for incidental charges such as henna stain in towels or bed sheet. ",3,March 2014
"My family and friends have checked in at this hotel for 3 times already and we are not dissappointed everytime we came back because we make sure that we are booked at the executive wing. This hotel is pretty much average than the rest of the 3 star hotel in boracay but because the executive wing was relatively new when we booked way back 2009, everytime we came back, we book here for convenience and familiarity. The booking comes with breakfast which is ordinary and a dinner buffet which is just okay considering its free. Situated at station 2, this hotel is recommended for those who wants to be where the action is at night.",3,April 2013
Terrible experience do not go here. Massive amount of people on cheap package tours. There was banging from renovations literally from 8 am until 6 pm everyday. You cannot actually use the free wi fi. It's just a cynical rip off of tourists which most of Boracay is anyway.,1,March 2014
"Nothing special about this place. Typical hotel room with beds, aircon and normal restroom. Friendly hotel staff though. Avail their breakfast buffet and I'm kinda dissappointed. Food was pretty the same everyday. You have to start the day waiting for table and food to be refilled for you to be able to have breakfast. Could use a lot of improvement!",3,May 2013
"the trip in from the airport was great, we had the whole bus to share with two other couples. then    a short boat ride to a pier ,where a nice van picked us up to the hotel for check-in . They were  very nice and helped us to our room , it was nice and clean . We went straight for the beach.  The warm white sand and blue water was right out side the front of the resort. you will pass  the pool and dinning area on your way there. They had a shaded area and Beach chairs for  you to use and helper to get you a drink from the hotel , It was great relaxing stay, and the  morning breakfast was an added bonus .",4,April 2013
Indeed a budget hotel but the very friendly staff is doing the best to make you feel confortable. Besides the staff a plus was the clean and spacious room and the proximity to the beach. Weak point to consider to improve: the too small breakfast restaurant,4,March 2014
The a/c unit was so loud and it wasn't mounted properly. there was a leak in the restroom. The light in the ceiling was falling apart the pool looked extremely dirty an they barely had a good breakfast selection. Oh an there was Mosquitos in the room biting my wife. And they called it executive rooms. Towels are old and the tv don't have proper signal. ,1,March 2014
"Stayed in this hotel during typhoon yolanda(this is a late review).i have to commend the staff from the supervisors to all their attendants, they were very considerate during those times.though the rooms were not magnificient, A/C not wrking well, hot shower as well but the bed n d rest is ok.dont eat in the resto, not recommendable even the breakfast.better to buy mcdo or eat at other resto. Will stay in the family room, nice rooms n big enough for a group, A/C works well as well as the shower.(we stayed at 3 different rooms during our stay bec we wer stranded but the regular room, not so recomendable). The local govt of boracay as well as the tourism office they really SUCK, they dont know how to handle crisis, thousands of people wer stranded during yolanda n hoping to cross…",3,November 2013
"This a great little budget hotel. Included in our pre-purchased package from Travelonline Philippines, this hotel made it possible for me to travel along with 9 member of my family without having to rob a bank. The rooms are decent and the property is constantly being cleaned by its friendly staff.  Being situated within the borders of stations 2 & 3, visitors of this hotel have direct access to cheaper services and merchandise. I will definitely come back.",4,December 2013
"if you have a bad time at this resort....it is your own fault...as nothing is a problem for any of the staff at this beach front property. the staff are mainly young trainees, and are so willing to be of service to you... that they all scramble to be the 1st .it is very clean, safe, an has everything you need an  a bit more...but the beach has it even more so.the food is also budget buffet style, an you more than get to put on weight there, but also they have menu , an if you happen to catch your own , lobster or huge fish an crabs at the local wet market, the kitchen do a superb singapore chili mud crap or torepedo prawns",5,November 2013
"The great thing about La Carmela is the location - directly next to White Beach so you are there within a few footsteps. The other good thing is the price - it's very cheap, especially if booked as part of a group tour. However, that's pretty much where it ends as everything else I experienced was pretty bad. Room is in dire need of refurbishment and was pretty dirty (and that's after we swapped rooms due to being initially placed next to a building site). The room wasn't cleaned each day and the air con was unbelievably loud. Breakfast very busy and bad food. You had to pay to rent a beach towel. The pool is nice but affected by the smell from the nearby toilets. You get the picture - if you can put up with this for a cheap stay, then great. Otherwise, pay a bit more and stay…",2,February 2014
"La Carmela de Boracay is one of the best and yet so affordable hotel in Bora, its services was like the 5-7 stars hotel with their friendly staff, nice bed room and delicious food. For those budget travelers like me i really recommend it.  Thanks a lot.",4,October 2013
"We stayed at La Carmela for 1 week, what a huge mistake!! We would have cancelled our stay at this hotel but we have paid in full and could not get a refund. At 6000 Pesos a night, it was not particularly cheap. This hotel has been the worst hotel we have ever stayed at.  -The only good thing about this hotel is it's beachfront location but it apparently has over 400 rooms but does not have the facilities to support the number of guest it has staying. The restaurant is too small and there is not enough loungers at the beach. -We stayed at the executive wing in a panorama junior suit and there was absolutely nothing special about this room. Across the road La Carmela is building an extention to their already over populated chaotic hotel. It's very noisy from all their building…",2,January 2014
One of the most modest hotels I have stayed in. The rooms are basic motel rooms. The bathrooms are poor. The breakfast lacks anything delicious.... The pool looks lot bigger in picture.   Plus : The hotel transfer is good.,2,February 2014
"Stayed at this hotel for 3 nights and 4 days.  SO DISAPPOINTED.  My nephews and nieces first time to come and visit the Philippines and  we were  really excited to come and see Boracay for the first time.  We stayed December 31, 2013 to January 3, 2014.  There were 22 of us and got 6 rooms.  When we got to the hotel, the staff were really nice,  very accommodating.  First disappointment,  we were asked to put a deposit of 2,000 pesos per room.  I asked if they can just use my credit card that we used to book but no they need cash, ok we gave them cash.  When we got to the rooms,  3 rooms had cockroaches.  4 of the bathrooms had the toilets clogged.  It's nice that they will just come in your room if one of the guests are present but you'll be waiting for a long time and be…",1,December 2013
"Stayed here with my family. Rooms are clean. Staffs are nice but the reception area are always crowded. Too many korean guests that they serve kimchi for breakfast, but thats ok, koreans are nice and i like kimchi, its just that it would be nicer if they can control the crowd. When you arrive, you expect that you get a warm welcome, but because of the crowd, you'd have to request for your welcome drink. Not a good welcome, i must say.",3,July 2013
"Excellent hotel for value for money. The only plus factor in this hotel is the location and the price. Located at station 2 you are in the middle of the island. A few steps from D Mall and nearby popular shops and resto. The service is slow considering there are a lot of visitors especially during peak seasons, so expect the crew to be super busy. I tried the breakfast and buffet lunch and dinner, my recommendation is dine somewhere else. A good choice for budget travel",3,November 2013
"We stayed in La Carmela for over a week. After reading all reviews we were a bit pushed off with this hotel, but since we came in we were positively suprised. Excellent location, nice hotel overview, clean with friendly staff.   Our standard room is not too bad, maybe old fashioned but bathroom need small improvement ( especially shower).   Generally, hotel is really good, close to everywhere, good service, rooms got everything what you need ( tv, balcony, safety box, fridge etc).  What we didnt like is the breakfast. Overcrowded, Europeans cant find here anything, all food is only for asians, so maybe if the hotel wants also guest from Europe they need to think of adding some different food not only heavy asian meals, maybe some cheese would be nice or vegetables?  To sum up,…",4,January 2014
"This hotel is central on White Beach.  For it's location their price is definitely a good value.  Service is average but the staff is very courteous and respectful.    My main beef with them is the NOT free wireless internet inside your rooms and the NOT free beach towels (you have to pay each time you want clean ones too,)   Otherwise, this hotel rates well, I think.  I do appreciate that the they allowed early check-in for my family when we arrived 11AM.",4,January 2014
"Stayed at La Carmela for 3 nights, we have the executive deluxe room in the executive wing. This I believe was their new building which is located at the back so its a long walk to the beach. Room features are just average. We just have some problems with the bathroom though. The water from all the faucet were dirty, I don't know if its sand coming out from it but its kinda brownish color. Even the water from the toilet have this. We then have to call some assistance to the lobby to fix it. Breakfast buffet seems to be just repeating its menu everyday. A long walk also when going to D'Mall and station 1.   Overall, just an ordinary hotel, service and cleanliness should improved and a long walk to the bars and restaurant at D'Mall.",2,November 2013
"This is the 5th time I have been to ""Boracay"", and 1st time staying at the La Carmela.  All I can honestly say is that ""Location is great"" being right in front of the beach and service isn't too bad. Other than that, everything is just average.  The Bad...  1: The room that we got when we arrived (raining at the time) was actually leaking. The rain was coming in even though the window was close and the bathroom was looking like it is in need of a serious cleaning. We did get transferred to another room after calling reception and an inspection from one of the staff to may sure the room was actually leaking.  2: The floor feels like it hasn't been thoroughly clean in a very long time like the bathroom.  3: The aircon was very noisy and pretty sure wasn't working as our room just…",3,December 2013
"Good location, beach front. Rooms are quite crowded but still okay. Staffs are hospitable, they entertain your requests (cleaning, change sheets, etc.). They even allowed us to leave our things in their premises so we can roam around and kill time before our flight back to Manila.",3,July 2013
"It's my 3rd time to visit the island. I'm supposed to stay in Boracay Regency, but due to uncontrolled circumstances, I have to rebooked. Since there is no available room in Regency on my choosen date, they gave me list of some hotels and I decided to go with La Carmela, but I upgraded my accommodation. I've read most of the reviews about La Carmela, then I thought it's a bad choice. But upon checked- in the staff are courteous enough to great me with a smile. And upon checking the room, its fair enough for the amount that I paid and it's half of the total payment that I'm supposed to pay with Regency. Breakfast is buffet type. One tip is go early for breakfast, since they are open fr. 6-10 AM and they serve it in 3 different areas. I always go to ground floor of the executive…",3,January 2014
"This is a great place for those looking for a budget hotel. It has a great location, being right on the beach and in-between both ends of Boracay beach. I found the service to be above average, really depending on which staff you get. The rooms are comfortable but are not very well maintained. We booked 3 rooms and each room had something wrong with them. However, you get what you pay for and if you are on a budget but are looking for a place that is on the beach, then this place is perfect.",3,January 2014
"My stay at this hotel is part of a package tour for a 3D2N stay.  The room we got was at the 3f of the standard wing. La Carmela has an executive wing but we did not stay there so this review is just for the standard rooms.   We had an airconditioned 2 double-bed room with toilet, ref, phone, old tv and a small veranda with a table, chairs and something to hang your wet clothes with. I think all rooms have these. However, our room was located at the middle part of the building, where there was an ongoing construction at the right side (if facing the beach) of the hotel. Due to that, we were directly facing a wall when we stand outside by the veranda, and noises of hammers and construction begin around 9am. Can't see the beach much from there but if you got the other rooms (left…",3,January 2014

Been here many times and always get satisfactory rating because of its convenience in terms of location, service, ambiance and free breakfast :p they offer everything to you from transfers to free meals. so it's really very okay for people who go there to make the most out of their boracay trip with lesser budget. Most agreeable is the location as it is beachfront, halfway of station 1 and 3.   They keep on expanding and improving their resort, that's also a thumbs up. The only turn off is that most of the time the elevator is not working and they could have extended the time for the…",4,November 2013
"We stayed at the hotel from January 9 to 15 January 2014. It was a bad hotel. The room was just up to a construction site. It was crowded for breakfast, so it was impossible to get a place to sit. There was no service at the front desk. For example, we could not get two towels even though they had only put two very small towels in the room. So we had to pay extra. Internet was extremely bad and slow. We can not recommend La Carmela.",2,January 2014

Have to transfer to 3 different rooms in our first night as the first two rooms that they gave us have cockroaches, the fridge stinks, phone was not working, air con was not functioning well, all together it was a very old and dirty room, even the linens & towels was stained and filthy. The amenities was just a leftover from the guest that left. To top it up the staff in the reception was not accommodating at all.       After upgrading to another room that we choose, which was very expensive and over rated.

"I'm a Phil-Am but have been in the US for 40 years.  This is my first time to Boracay.  I heard about some hotel by ""Boy Abunda"".  Honestly,I don't even know who that is.  But my mother-in-law talked about staying somewhere close to this place [she was planning on bartering for her hotel room  somewhere nearby].  So we booked a family suite with a loft.  My kids really liked the layout of the room.  But to me it was nothing special.  We've stayed in much nicer places before.  The hotel has literally a handful of rooms that face the beach.  But the resort is narrow and a majority of the rooms face inward galleys through the hotel, not the beach.  Luckily, since we were on the 4th floor, while we did not have any view of the ocean, we were high enough to have a view of a building…",2,November 2013
First time vacationing in Boracay and had an amazing experience.  We stayed at La Carmela and was greeted by the staff with a welcome cocktail.  Had no issues with the hotel or staff. If we needed anything the staff was very accommodating and quick to respond.  Will definitely recommend hotel to family and friends. Looking forward to our next visit to the beautiful island.,5,December 2013
"my family and i stayed here (rm 414 w/ mezzanine) just recently, very uncomfortable stay!!! when we entered the room, toilet stinks (no matter how many times we washed the toilet), no floor mats (come to think of it, thats one of the important things we need because were always wet coming from the beach, pool and shower) already used or have not change amenities (e.g. shampoo it was almost empty when we first entered the room, water just drips no pressure. the staff, they have their own time even when there are costumers waiting to be settled, they play around with co-staff!!! not so friendly too!! they are using the people of showbiz to attract people but the hotel itself, its like the ones behind the camera!!",1,January 2014
"Me and my husband stayed at the hotel for 4 nights. The location is very good and the staff as well, always smiling and greet but unfortunately its not enough.  The room was poor, not even a bed side lamp.. we had no hot water and it took them an hour to fix it, the sink smelled bad like something died inside the pipes. Other than the room which we had to ask them to clean because it's the hotel policy! ? The elevator wasn't working at least 3 hours a day, the breakfast was an absolute disgrace! In general it felt like they pretend to clean but don't really clean because the hotel just smelled bad. So do yourselves a favor and find a different hotel. ",1,January 2014
We stayed 2 nights  @ the Primier West Bldg. The place is clean and the staff are friendly. You can easily stroll along the beach and walk around the area leisurely because of the accesibility of it's location. I can say it's a good place to stay for a budget-wise vacation.,4,October 2013
"Stayed for 4 nights in Premier West bldg.  My main issue to this hotel was that in the booking process the management was not transparent enough to inform prospective customers of regular power interruptions. Understandable for Boracay but at least put them upfront!  Check-in is a breeze. Though the Receptionist has the weirdest spiel in the world. From henna tattoo to ""rooms are not cleaned everyday and guess need to queue etc etc"" Bizarre really.  The room is clean. Nothing special. Weird bathroom setup though. Shower room does not have any fixture to hold shampoo/conditioner only soap holder in the wall. The management should try to take a bath here to understand what I mean. And why only half of a partition for the shower room? It made sure the whole floor is wet after…",3,December 2013

Facilities is also good and also very accommodating staffs. I would like to recommend this hotel and I'm considering to bring my family here maybe next year.",3,August 2013
"We stayed at La Carmela de Boracay Resort Hotel last December 17-18. Location is very good because it's just a stone's throw away from the White Beach and the  restaurants, stores, attractions, etc. are situated near the hotel. Facilities are well-maintained. I think the swimming pool is one of the attractions of this hotel. Staff are pleasant but some of them doesn't greet nor acknowledge you even if they could already see you walking towards them. Customer service and friendliness of staff can be improved more.   When it comes to the room, it was impressive enough except for the TV. HORRIBLE SIGNAL AND CABLE CONNECTION. Bed comfort okay.

There are many restaurants, bars, supermarket, police station, tourist center, etc. I was quite surprise for my room at executive wing. It was not that bad. Room might be a bit old, but it offered everything we need, except a hair dryer. Air-condition was loud. Sometime water in the room had no pressure. Elevator was not working. Internet was slow and hard to connect. There is powercut for sometime. Breakfast was ok. Service is good for a big resort. In total, I satisfy with this hotel.",4,December 2013

The staff was attentive enough and accommodating, the room had the right size but the air-condition struggled to make the whole room cold. The swimming pool didn't look so clean, but satisfactory. Food was also very average, I personally went elsewhere to eat as Boracay has tons of choices to fill your gastronomical cravings.   Overall If you're looking for a no frills place to stay in Boracay then I would definitely recommend this place as Boracay would make up for any short comings this resort has. If you're looking for a Class A resort then I would suggest to look elsewhere.  Verdict: No thumbs up, no thumbs down",3,October 2013
The room is ok but nothing special..I think the only thing why many people staying there it's because is famous because local celeb always mentioned is on tv !

There's a lot if hotels there that' s not expensive also really good..isa pa sa compalian ko sa la Carmella is always no power ..all the other hotel ndi nagpapatay ng generator except them!

The bus ride from Kalibo airport was a bit tiring but we made the most out of it. We got in the hotel early in the morning and we were glad that our rooms were ready.

I booked a room for three consecutive nights at La Carmela de Boracay as a birthday treat to my nephew on his birthday. Since it was a birthday treat and also our first trip to Boracay I thought of paying a decent price for a decent accommodation to make it more memorable. La Carmela de Boracay has been featured on TV by celebrity endorsers so I thought it was a good pick. The room as OK but the housekeeping is not. We only found one set of soap and shampoo inside the bathroom although they were fully aware that there are two guests. There was no face/hand towels provided. They gave us vouchers for breakfast and we were surprised to see how inadequate the food and drinks were.

"I've been wondering why some say the place is bad while some say the place is good. So when we went to Boracay, I saw the place for myself and no, I can't make a stand between good and bad. You see, la carmela de boracay is neither. This hotel is a mix of in between - the good and the bad - which means it's affordable and satisfying and nothing at all grand and luxurious. So if you have average expectations, then this place is certainly the place to go.  The hotel is always full of employees (in the lobby, the room hallways, the pool, the restaurants). In the good side, you always have someone to ask or inquire with. On the bad side, the place gets awfully crowded and really loud. The room itself is small. I have no complaints here, since Hotels are for sleeping. I don't need a…",3,October 2013
Airport pickup was fine as I personally called them for the transfer service and date/time of arrival. Flew in from Caticlan and it was the smoothest experience I had going to Boracay. They fetched me at the airport and they had their OWN seaport for their OWN boat to the island. I was the only passenger on the boat while the other boats to the island was packed. I felt special.   Check-in was too busy. Room was quite big but hotel isn't really a beach-front. You have to walk a few minutes to get to the beach depending on your room location. We stayed at the annex building. NO FREE INTERNET in room and no signal for mobile phone. Internet is tooooo expensive. Don't bother. Free internet however at the hotel lobby. Breakfast was set. Staff were not attentive and had mixed up on…,4,October 2013
"My cousins and I stayed in this hotel resort for 3d2n and thought it was good value for money. Overall we thought the place was average compared to other resorts. The pool was the first thing that caught my attention to this place, thinking that it was huge but disappointingly it wasn't. It was quite a major let down as I wanted to dive in to the pool and experience the resorts' facilities. The room we had was not exactly beachfront although we did request it to be. The room size was just right for 3 people and included a sky satellite for tv, airconditioning and a safe vault. The only downturn was there was no bath math provided..The aircon was lovely leaving the room cold for hours after switch off and there was surprisingly little noise made in the corridor although we were…",3,October 2013
"we stayed in La Carmela for 3 days. It was as average hotel. rooms were clean but had a major issue with the drainage in the bathroom. it was clogged the whole time we were there. reported it several times but no one came to assist us. if your just looking for a decent place to stay for a day or two, this hotel would be fine. but don't expect a excellent customer service from the reception as most of them were rude. (especially the ladies). Also, their towels are all worn out. they should consider replacing them.",3,October 2013
"Stayed in La Carmela for three days and did not encounter any issues except for the breakfast but not really a big deal (a bit salty corned beef :p )     When I got there, check-in is fast (Main Building) and the room assigned to me is on the third floor. Standard room is descent, with two double beds, can accommodate max of 4 pax but I stayed solo so I did have a lot of space.      The rate is okay compared for other same category hotel (do not expect a five star treatment for that price).      Washroom is clean and well-functioning with sufficient water pressure.     Had to buy the ""100 peso for one hour"" in-room internet access card"" and thought that was not so reasonable but I got no choice for I have a pending business.      Overall, the hotel's shortcomings are not really…",4,October 2013
"This was my second stay in La Carmela and just like what I've said in my first review last May 2013, the hotel is for budget travellers so do not expect 5-star facilities. Location is the best asset of this property. Also, the price is good for a beachfront property, a clean and airconditioned room and free breakfast. But let me get to some points that they need to improve on soon, or the location and price will no longer be a reason for me to stay here again on my future trips to Boracay. First, the molds in the bathroom door were very obvious. I can clearly say that they do not clean the bathroom properly. Second, the free wifi in the dining area is slower than the last time I was there. The room we stayed in at the 4th floor (A27) had no view as it was in the attic, had only…",3,October 2013
"We've been here twice, overall, the room is clean, nice and decent. Though it is small. Also, the staff lacks personal touch with their guests.

"The room we had was alright considering what we paid for. It was also fully booked.   The location is so-so. It depends on your idea of Boracay. If it's about the beach then it's good, it's a few steps away from the beach (But so is most of the other hotels & guest houses with much lower price).  If you prefer partying then it's not too good, it's a bit far from the Party Scene. 5 mins walk to Summer Place and 6-7 Mins walk to Epic Bar.  If you feel like doing water activities such as para-sailing, helmet diving etc. then it's really really far. I'd say 12 mins walk (and yes you have no choice but to walk) to the dock stations & registration booth of water activities.   The WORST breakfast I ever had. You walk in to a room full of mess, the coffee/juice is self serving (which is…",1,October 2013
"When going to Boracay, my family always stay at this hotel. When my sister got married, we opted La Carmela because the people are very accomodating, easy to deal with and very warm. (Kudos to Yong Amodia and Love!) They have function rooms and beach set up as well. Booking online is easy.   Cheap rates.  Rooms, not that good (but you cannot expect a 5-star hotel type when paying low rates) and anyways, we didn't go to Boracay just to stay in a hotel.   Toilet and bath are tolerable.   Breakfast, well an ala-carte menu for 2 is inclusive but if you want to have a buffet breakfast you can just add Php 130.00 (i think).   To sum it up, La Carmela is on top of my list when looking for a hotel in Boracay.",4,September 2013
"It was our first time to visit Boracay, so we were so excited and don't even know what are there for us. My brother in law booked this hotel for us, kinda happy too coz Boy Abunda is the endorser of this hotel.. I mean Boy Abunda is ""some one""! To cut it short we are very disappointed after a long journey just to get into this hotel.. We don't really expect much because this is a 3 star hotel. The room is ok for but there's no basic toiletries.. There were 1 very small soap and very tiny plastic bottle w/ a half content of shampoo w/ conditioner (this is the indication of the bottle) Funny and Pathetic!

The stay included a set breakfast which was ok. We have to inform the reception about getting the room cleaned every time we need. Speaking about the negative aspects, the shower in the bathroom was pathetic, didnt have hot water. The air conditioner was not working properly.

"Stayed here for 3 days and 2 nights (aug. 28-30, 2013). We were given 3 hotels to choose from, but since this is located in station 2, near the DMall i immediately pushed the booking for this hotel. We are a group of 31, a bit large for the small lobby (waiting area of the hotel). We arrived quite early.. considering it was lean season, they didn't allow us to have an early check-in; instead they just offered to keep our baggage at the baggage counter so we can proceed with our trip to Mt. Tapyas and Puka Beach.  Location - a few steps away from the beach. As in!

So I just took a picture outside the hotel. The staff were not that friendly. They only offer drinks to foreigners upon arrival. The housekeeping was not consistent in their answers. I requested for an extra pillow, their first answer was it's not possible to have an extra pillow. My husband called again and he was given an extra pillow with a charge of 30Php/pillow. It was not so clean. The furnitures are old. There's no view at the hotel balcony that we got.There's an unlimited drinking water supply at the hallway.

"This hotel is just ok.  The room is clean, staff is mostly friendly.  The pool is nice.    Cheaper rooms are a long way away from the beach, though.  They might was well be a different hotel that isn't on the beach, in fact, they are in separate buildings, which IMO, pretty much makes them a different hotel that isn't on the beach. You even check in at a different front desk.    Some other things I don't like.  You can't EVER charge anything to your room, not even room service.  Can't charge drinks at the pool to you room, so you have to carry cash to the pool area. ""free"" breakfast buffet (misleading because you have to pay p100 for the buffet"") is just horrible.

I think not bad for the amount that that we paid for.   The hotel itself is just enough for people looking for much cheaper or affordable hotel near beach front of station 2. The hotel itself is clean and smell good. People are also accomodating and nice. We stayed there from Sep 29-Oct 2, it's not peak season yet so we dont have much hassle in our stay. Also, they allowed us to have early check in since we arrived there so early.

Aside from it is located in the corner and end of corridor, the toilet bowl has no flash, and the water is sooo weak. That made my day sooo awful. I asked also for water but no attendant came to our room to deliver the water. The basic need that we only asked from them. Maybe La carmela is a good choice but definitely there's a lot more good accommodation. It was frustrating and disappointing. ",3,October 2013

It was clean and we had no issues with their staff.  They were pleasant and accommodating.  The breakfast was a simple meal and will not get you hungry until lunch time.  I am not a big fan of Boracay, per se.  This was my first visit and was shocked!  I had to change my mind set and would not compare Boracay to the beaches of Cancun, Mexico or the beaches of Cuba and Dominican Republic.  I will come back to Boracay having accepted the fact that it is very different from all the beach vacation destinations we have been to!

For us- a couple, we enjoyed the amenities of the resort. the beachfront, the  swimming pool. friendly staff, free drinking water. .  we upgraded to buffet breakfast and had two buffet dinner during our stay, the food is okay, nothing so special, fits for 280pesos budget. special mention to their pandan cake =)   we availed the hotel spa service for only 300pesos.   quite far from D'mall, bars, and some shops but not complaining, we tried something different this time.",4,September 2013

Something like corned beef on toast and something I'm not sure of.  (Neither of which I would feed to my dog.)  To upgrade to something a little more edible, there was a 100php fee.  Talk about “bait and switch”. Per Agoda  the room was    a Premier Deluxe with breakfast.  When I looked at the hotel web site, they don't have any  Premier Deluxe rooms.   As for the room amenities listed by Agoda, there was no complimentary bottled water , mini bar or balcony-terrace.

kids love this place but for the price there are many competitive other accommos on boracay. location is fantastic and front desk run by steph actually made the stay worthwhile. the key is not to be angry but give steph a little time to work the problem and she was one of the best front desk of ANY hotel i've ever traveled internationally. they will lose her to a 5 star hotel eventually- she's a pro working with amateurs. buffet food is convenient but barely mediocre. staff makes up for the inadequacies of the hotel. but the traffic of visitors there is horrendous and the staff are overworked- yet are the friendliest i've met in 20 years. it's a go if you have kids but if you are single i would definitely check alternatives.,3,September 2013

After island hopping, me and my friends are already tired and hungry. we were planning to go as far as station 1 to search for good food. then we saw and stumbled upon La Carmela's lunch menu for the day. not bad for P285.00 per person so we got ourselves seated and eating. Asian and Italian dishes were served that day. the meals were light and beautifully presented. the desserts are not so bad too. my favorite is the tuna mango salad, the lettuce is crunchy and the mango salsa sauce is perfect. oh, and the buffet comes with unlimited iced tea also.",4,July 2013
"We have been to Bora a bunch but usually stay at our local favorite secret just a few doors down. This time, due to a mix up and fully booked statuses, we bought one of those voucher deals online. We ended up with 3 adults (could have had 4 for no extra charge) and an infant with 2 breakfasts included (they were not good at all though, but we didn't expect them to be) for around $48 dollars per night including tax which is a deal, especially being right on the beach. They have a nice pool that kids can swim in. The room, specifically the sink needs a lot of work and they still have an old t.v. but we were not there to hang out in the room except to shower, change, or sleep. The room has a mini refrigerator and a safe which come in handy. Great location for island hopping,…",3,July 2013
"Just looks on pictures in their website it looks okay not a five star hotel but it's fine for 3d2n stay, but when we got there... terrible! what we have is an ""executive"" room sounds nice huh? all we got is a four cornered dark room with a view of the next building wall. Too far from the pictures in their ad... Breakfast? forget about it! even the buffet if you upgrade, nuh! The overall cost is cheap but still you will feel that you have been robbed at the end of the day.  The only and probably the best thing they can boost about this hotel are their STAFF! excellent for them 5 star experience; if not for them I would classify this hotel as a prison cell",2,June 2013
"I stayed the hotel with family and friends. We had booked three rooms. The first two rooms were okay but the other has poor a/c and it often smells of smoke. The location was a very big plus. It's right in front of the beach and near enough to walk to restaurants and souvenir shops. Two things I didn't like about the hotel: First, the lack of signal for our cellphones and wifi. It seems like it's being blocked whenever we enter our rooms. Free wifi has a so-so connection at the restaurant and you have to pay to have a wifi inside your room. And lastly, the pool seems dirty and poorly maintained. I did not dare swim in it. If you intend on staying here and on a budget its ok as that's what you're paying for but I bet there are better hotels along white beach.",3,July 2013
"Our 3D-3N stay at la carmela de boracay was superb! The staff were very welcoming-- the group of ""Bogs Bunny"" Roxanne and the security guards. The front desk officer attended to all our needs and requests properly. Apparently our standard room came with no hair dryer nor hot water dispenser but since we requested, we were able to get them. We were able to request for drinking water as well... We enjoyed fast free wi-fi at the restaurant and even free coffee :) I was so happy to recharge my laptop/ iphone from power outlets peeping from behind our tables. Our breakfast was okay. Toasts, meat, eggs, juice coffee... rooms are also okay..but the treatment of the staff when we were there made me give this 3-star resort hotel 10/10 rating!!! Will definitely stay there next time :)",5,July 2013
"Due to the many negative feedbacks I read about this hotel, I still booked one night 'cause I was thinking 'how bad can it be?'... According to their website: it's beach front, two pools, & free breakfast.  Well, from the beach, it looks like an ok hotel....But the pool by the beach is murky. The pool at the back is the size of a jacuzzi, not a pool, almost can be mistaken dor a fountain. The room I got was at the ""executive wing."" Which confused me 'cause it was a tiny dark room with a view of a roof. wi-fi did not work at that building. There was a free breakfast, but almost everybody paid the fee to upgrade for buffet. Check-in took about 20 minutes, they ask for a deposit (2000P). Check-out took longer 'cause they wouldn't return my deposit until they're sure that I didn't…",3,June 2013
"I was looking forward to an improved La Carmela, but.... to my surprise, it was a disappointing  stay.   When I first stayed at La Carmela, it was a promising hotel-resort that time, but after 2 years, the hotel has vast expansion, but the quality of service has dropped considerably. The quality of food too. Breakfast is a big disappointment, the quality of rice is very poor and the way the food was cooked is comparable to a carinderia.  We were given the room on the main building and the room needs a lot of improvement. The room itself is not freshly-scented.   In terms of service, the staff are not so friendly. Process of checking in is very slow, much more in checking out.  I really hope this things will improve in the future. Sayang ang ganda ng location nila if they will…",2,July 2013
"We stayed here last week july 15 and it was very disappointing. Similar to the previous post, washrooms are filled with ANTS, crawling all over the face towels they provide(gross) called houskeeping and they sent someone to spray the washroom but ants would still come back. Towels are dirty and yellow. I called 3 times in one day for housekeeping to clean our room and front desk would say ""proceeding"" as in someone is on their way.... Waited & noone came to clean our room... The worst part of it all.... As soon as i entered the room i guess they had forgotten to change the bed sheets because there wad blood all over my bed! Never again. Worst service ever. Stay away. There are far better resorts to choose from at a reasonable price",1,July 2013

It was almost for free also with flight from Manila and all transfers. I had experience that staff was polite and friendly. Specially barman's and bartenders. I appreciated there service and there were satisfied with my tips. I just turn my head to bar from the beach and I had my new cocktail within few second with me.

I cant complain specially when I know that all those people work there almost for cup of soup and some tips.",4,October 2012

The breakfast that came with the room is a JOKE. It came with a single piece of chicken and a LOAD of rice, the egg was CRAPPY and uncooked. the breakfast buffet was ok but with a prize of course. the room was terrible, FIRST there ware ANTS in the bathroom when we got to our room, the bathtub is CLOGGED and we ended up being changed into another room after I complained and made a scene in…",3,June 2013
"Me and my family stayed at this hotel last summer vacation. We stayed in their family room at the what they called ""Atic"". Room was spacious that it could accommodate up to  8 persons, my parents loved the room as well. The location was nice because it was accessible to nearby shops and restaurants. Our stay was good but it will be more appreciated if there staff will learn to greet and accommodate guests well (just like other resorts). For me, having a good customer service can be one of the best asset that a hotel can have. The pool was small and needs maintenance, the food was average.",3,April 2013
"The only good thing about this resort is that you're close to the beach. We booked one of the ""oceanview"" rooms which of course cost more than the regular rooms. Our view was not of the ocean but of the swimming pool! The way the hotel faces, it's not even possible to have an oceanview room.  I think this is very misleading and should be corrected on their website. It was a good thing we weren't in our room much because it was always so rowdy at the pool and at night (I think just on the weekend) they do a fire dance show. Needless to say it was very loud and not an ideal room for those looking to just relax. The room itself was ok. The air turns off when you take the key out so it was always hot when we came back to go to bed at night and it took forever to cool the room off. I…",2,June 2013

The airconditioning was crappy and the staffs was not that attentive to standard -booked guests. I noticed the difference because the first time we booked there, we were upgraded to premium suites and the hotel staffs were so friendly. but the second time when my family booked the standard room, we have to call the front desk three times before their staff can accomodate us. its like we were put on the last of the list.  we don't feel prioritized at all.  the overall, its an average hotel if you like to mind your own business.",3,May 2013

Ideally, i have booked this on november, thats why im expecting a preferred priority on their list. To my dismay, on our arrival, we were not given adjacent rooms. I asked the receptionist about my situation and she just shrugged and told me that the rooms she gave to me are located on the same floor. I was tired to argue, so i just accepted it.

It was a bit small, given the price. Breakast was so so. It's a set breakfast during off peak season and you will have to pay additional fee to avail of the buffet which I highly discourage guests to avail.

I paid about $100 per night. I paid a fair bit extra for an ""ocean view room"". There was NO VIEW of the ocean at all, however, if you walked out onto the tiny balcony you could JUST see a bit of sand.  Despite paying for several nights in full via agoda, I had to pay 2,000 pesos as a cash deposit.   The buffet was simply digusting.  The air con was so bad that I had to sleep with a wet towel over my body to get cool.  They do not make up your rooms unless you request it specifically.

The people who helped out with moving us and bringing our bags to the room were lovely.  However, to sit a group of 7 people at the buffet on the beach did not happen and we were standing in line for so long, when we were told by a waitress that a table was free another waitress put a smaller group on the big table we were going to sit on.

The location is good however in Station 2, in the center of everything that's happening in White Beach. Besides, I recommend that you spend most of your time outside, on the Boracay sands.

A small stain on bed sheet amounting to 2,500php and in pillow amounting to 450php with a total of 2950php for a just a stain.   They said the Henna stain is not removable that's why they did not used/set-up again the said bed sheet and pillow... its a big lie, after washing and using bleaching solution now its cleaned and no marks of Henna Tattoo stain.

Immediatley we noticed a massive contrast. The rooms that we were allocated were much more basic compared to those featured in the pictures above. La Carmela is a huge hotel, with small rooms and even smaller bathrooms! The noise level was quite high, but i would attribute this to the fairly cheap price of rooms, making it a popular destination for party goers.   We only sampled breakfast once in the hotel, and when doing this we noticed large signs stating that if we did not finish everything on our plates that we would be charged.

Upon return, I still see the hang tag ""make up room"" in the door knob. It is only when I called the attention of the housekeeper that they started to make up our room.

My fondest memory of La Carmela, as I've recounted all too often time friends, is this: After we unpacked from our arrival, I went to the pool out front for a quick dip and a beer. I ordered a Red Horse (going around the Philippines? Gotta ride the Horse!) from the bartender, leaving my full hundred pesos on the counter. Next time past the bar, I heard, ""Sir! Red Horse?""

However, I have to say that the moment we got to the reception area of the hotel, I already got the feeling that our stay would not be pleasant at all.  The whole complex felt so claustrophobic, with concrete walls all around.  Seems like the developer crammed in as much hotel rooms as they could  in such a limited space!

The Room: Quad-sharing, 2 beds, ref, cable tv, AC, closet safety box. The room was kinda small, but I guess it was good enough since we were out of the room most of the time.  The room has no WIFI access, only the lobby has WIFI. Walls aren't soundproof, you can hear all the noise from your neighbors or crew outside.  The Food (Breakfast): The food wasn't too great, typical bland hotel food.  My friends upgraded their meals to buffet, but still, the food didn't taste that great.",3,March 2013
"Most of La Carmela's room locations don't have the good view of the sea, not even the beachfront. I think that that they need to give more life with their building's interior and exterior designs. But I also think that they have some good customer service, as well as, tight security. Again, my rate would be okay, not too bad but not too good. :)",3,January 2013
"The hotel is OK! Had to request to change room because the previous room smelled like sewer. Air freshener don't help either. Help desk and staff are very friendly and accommodating. Food is OK, nothing special. It has an OK pool for all ages. Location is good, close to seaside.",2,March 2013
"WE enjoy staying here for 7 days and 6 nights, we have lots of fun ,we have a privacy,they give us  good service ,very affordable...I love to go back here again..The hotel is very was okay ,friendly crew ,good food,a lot of people coming everyday.You can walk everywhere and safe..",5,November 2012
"Stayed for 6 nights, and really enjoyed. I've been to Boracay many times and normally stay somewhere less grand. I was was impressed with the size, escpecially the front where the pool is. The rooms are decent and mine had a balcony. Normally i dont care about the resort as the beach and sea are right outside, but here i enjoyed a few evenings sitting by the pool. Breakfast was ok, mainly Asian foods. Only had bacon on one morning. i found the staff very nice and helpfull. The pool is really for kids but its still nice to sit by. Got quite alot of loungers on the beach, never had a problem finding one. I would definately stay here again if the price was right.",4,March 2013
"We had a fun time! We stayed for 3 days. The hotel was okay. A lot of people recommended the hotel as well. You'll never be bored because there are lots of things to do in Boracay during any time of the day. We went island hopping, snorkeling and scuba diving in the morning. While at  night, we would relax ourselves with music and hang out at the bar and restaurants. The most exciting thing we have done has got to be the banana boat ride. It was so much fun. I highly recommend it especially to the families who are travelling since it is very safe and even the kids will enjoy it. I have no big complaints except for the food. The breakfast buffet served was not really that delicious and we were only given a small variety to choose from so we had to eat breakfast in the restaurants…",3,May 2012
Had a funtastic 3day holiday in boracay stayed with this superb hotel people are amazing wearing smile always will go there again food is very pinoy with lots of choices and the scenery. Is great kids enjoyed shifting from the inside pool to the white beach and fabulous service from the crews are priceless,4,August 2012
"Stayed here as part of an office outing. We're a group of 30 individuals and we were housed in rooms good for four. The rooms are quite small, but with good a/c, cable tv and en suite t/b. Shower is hot (warm?) But there's no external temp control for it. Staff are pleasant and accommodating. The hotel comes with a pool that's okay with kids so those who'll bring their families will have tons to do. There's a fire dance show (the cultural part I found disconcerting and mildly offensive but the fire show was awesome!) Every evening so I'd suggest you avail of the buffet dinners. It's also close to the shopping area, which is a great bonus. Regarding the price, I can't really comment since it's an all-expense paid trip. I will say though that those of you planning to get tattoos…",4,March 2013
"So-so. Good for people who are not picky and don't mind the crowd. Bathroom was filthy and hot and cold shower wasn't working well. Their drains clogged up. Not really the perfect hotel that you want. Although their location is good since it's in station 2. The food was good but don't expect a lot. Some staffs are courteous, some are not. Just not the hotel that I will recommend. :)",2,March 2013
Breakfast was so so. Bulgogi and kimchi tasted anything like it. We requested for a room clean up and even asked the cleaners who told us we were 4th in the line up. When we got back after 5 hrs our room was still uncleaned we had to call and request again at 8:30 pm and wait for them to fiish while my kid was dripping wet in the terrace. A big part of the miniscule terrace was occupied with stagnant water that wont go out of the drain. The vault in the room was busted and cant be fixed so i had to carry all my valuables everytime we hit the beach. Water in the shower was very weak and the hot water comes and goes..everytime the nextdoor occupants talks we can actually just listen in to them. And to top it all I requested for a late check out and was willing to pay for it 2 days…,1,March 2013
"we were there last July 2012... we occupied a room in the attic... it was comfortable except that  when it rained, there was a leak which caused rain droplets at my head board, more so that there were heavy down pours during our stay... plus there was a rat that shared with our chips while we were out during our second day... on the brighter side, the staff were polite and always greet guests with smile, the room and halls were clean and the food served at their resto was okay... i can still consider la carmela on my next visit to bora... i'm sure the leak has been fixed and the rat is gone, though i may opt for other hotel..",3,July 2012
"We spent 3D2N in La Carmela. When we reached the jetty, there was transport to take us to the hotel. As we arrived, we were greeted by refreshing juice while waiting to check-in. The staff were great and friendly. A smile every where you go! The room was average. My room was on the 2nd floor. what i didnt like about it was when we opened the door of the balcony, all we saw was a wall...not even a garden if not the sea. That was the only disappointment i had. Room was clean and air conditioning was good. I had breakfast and lunch at the hotel. Food was yummy and variety was aplenty. At night we had a performance by dancers that blew fire. They were awesome. Very good. Acceptability to the beach was good. Overall.....loved spending my birthday there and wont mind going back again.…",4,March 2013
"As advertised through different media, I believe this hotel is overrated.   We stayed in one of their Executive Deluxe rooms in the Executive wing, 4F,  early this month.  PROS - Hotel Staff are generally friendly and accommodating - It has an elevator so you won't have a hard time going to your room if you are staying in the upper floors - Its location is right in the middle of the island beside the busy areas so you are near the shopping areas, restaurants, party area, etc..  CONS - Their swimming pool doesn't smell good and it seems the water hasn't been changed regularly. To be honest, the water smells like [--]. My child and I had been arguing the whole time since she wants to swim in the pool and I wouldn't allow her - The Air conditioner is only 0.75 HP and cannot make…",3,March 2013

Panorama suite (we upgraded our)The customer service is worst, when we arrived we waited 30 minutes to be picked up other hotel transfers are seamless.  This hotel is worst value for your money. There are much better hotels you can get.  Bad experience. ",1,March 2013
"Overall, La Carmela de Boracay is great! Great staff!!! Polite and very accomodating!!! The only thing is that the buffet breakfast isn't that impressive... But still, two thumbs up for La Carmela! We had fun!!!",4,March 2013
If you are on a budget. Then la carmela de boracay is ok. Located on boat station 2. With free breakfast. It is a very basic room. Just bed and side table. With a small bathroom. That's it! There is nothing great about this hotel. It is a cheap hotel. So don't expect for a lavish one.,3,August 2012
"THE SITUATION: 8 of us and booked 2 standard rooms for 4 days and 3 nights during the start of March.  OVERALL: Very basic with good service. Would recommend this place if you're on a budget, but want a beachfront accommodation.  PROS: - Near the beach. Even the rooms that were further away from the beach had good walkways...so in case you get drunk there's a smaller chance of you falling over. - Very fast housekeeping service! Everyday, we needed fresh towels and these were always delivered in less than two minutes. Of course, this could have been because we were in the ground floor, but at least we know that that they act on requests right away. - Considerate staff. We had to check out late the next day because our bag was stolen (don't worry, it was stolen when we were far…",3,March 2013
"The first trip in without the hotel staff to pick me up at the terminal. As I paid the pick up transportation I would expected there was someone to pick me up . The staff was friendly but only when I mentioned I work in hotel industry . My room was very far away ( near the corner) , for a lady travel alone should assign a room near the elevator for a single lady traveler. The room looks ""OKAY"" , but when I turn the A/C on the annoying noise was came out like a factory beside you. As after a long trip to the resort I just want to rest but with the annoying factory noise just so hard to get a good rest. And the second day before i leave the room , I placed the ""Make Up room"" sign and told one of the housekeeping staff before I leave but when I got back to my room in evening my…",1,August 2012
"Fantastic place to stay. It offers comfortable accommodation, friendly staff, great food and location at a very reasonable price. It's nice and very romantic to eat near the pool area while being entertained by their live band.There's plenty of option when it comes to the food they serve.",4,August 2012
"La Carmela PRICE and LOCATION combined was the BEST since I was there Feb.12-15,2013. There might be some other hotels that are more cheaper but they are not situated in a great location such as La Carmela. They are also the lowest full buffet-all you can eat per person in station 2 which has a fully lighted big tent and accommodating staff situated on the beach. I'll definitely consider in staying at La Carmela if I go to Boracay again. FYI, they have different rooms which would also fit your budget as well as shuttle service that would pick you up to/from the airport/s.",4,February 2013
"We were upgraded to a nice room. I hear complaints about the pool, but really the ocean is what it is really about, and it is gorgeous to eat in that area.   The only thing I would say is they should consider changing, is the cleaning product. I can't say I am complaining, because the room was spotless, and literally you could eat off the floor. We did gag every time we came in, but it was the cleanest room I have ever been in. If you want to impress me I suggest mildew inhibitor cleaning solution like a form of mild bleach.  I like what the owner stands for. You can see he has a heart for his people. There is lots, and lots of staff, and they are not hassled, and they serve with a smile.",5,January 2013
"This is the worst hotel I've ever stayed. Location is OK, but the service is very very terrible. The room was never cleaned, even after I asked the reception to do so. After my second complaint, they finally did it - in a sucked way. Really poor hotel. You have 1000 choices better than here in Boracay.",1,February 2013
The hotel is near the beach. It also has a pool but it's quite small for adults. Breakfast was ordinary. Overall the price is just right. The location is the strength of this hotel because it has a beach front. I might consider this the next time I go to boracay.,3,December 2012
"La Carmela is located in Station 2, just right distance if you want to go Station 1 or 3.  I love our balcony, so relaxing to be in the oceanfront room with balcony.  Staff were nice but there are few who needs more training regarding the information they know about the hotel and their surroundings.",5,January 2013
"We stayed there last March through WowPhilippines, and enjoyed it very much. We found the staff in particular to be quite friendly and accommodating. A healthy tip at the bar ensured a quick run of Red Horse, and the restaurant staff were always helpful.Our Executive wing room was quite adequate for our needs: brief periods of rest before hitting the sun, sand and surf. The beach, the boardwalk, the amazing sunsets, and the wonderful people ensured we had an awesome time. Make sure you go island hopping, and don't forget to buy your own snorkelling gear.",4,March 2012
I found the place noisy with loud bangs of people closing doors and kids running up and down the halls witch you could hear in your room . The place was clean. The pool a nice spot to sit around. Breakfast was not so good. I found the place was a bit over priced for what it was but in saying that it's in a good spot close to most things a short walk to the D Mall.,3,March 2012
"I purchased a 4D/3N standard room accommodation at La Carmela Resort, Boracay from an Online Group Buying Site. The location was nice (beach front), the receptionists were friendly, and the staff were helpful. There are 2 swimming pools that are perfect for small kids, but very small for an adult. But unfortunately the standard room that we got was terrible. It has no view, the aircon could not keep up with the summer heat, the location of the room was in a secluded part of the hotel that one time I got lost locating it. The buffet breakfast was nothing special.",3,May 2012

The elevator nearest ours is not functioning during the time of our stay. My mother is already 58 y/o and is suffering knee pains and is no longer capable for long walks and running up and down the stairs. No wheelchair available. We are not granted to be transferred to a standard room in the lower floors, though we agreed to a lower room category than what we paid and reserved for. We have to go through long walks up to the 4th floor and through the hallway before arriving to our room. There are no room slippers considering that the floor is so cold due to the aircon. There is also no room foot rag considering that the floor is…",2,October 2012

We stayed 4 nights and rate was approx $155 per night. This was supposed to have been a ""Special Rate"". While the room was clean and bedding comfortable I noted the following...  Negatives  Ocean Views amount to a slither of water through Coconut Trees. This Wing overlooks the Pool and there is some noise though at 9pm all action stops. Very noisy airconditioner...an obsolete relic from days gone by even though this Wing is only a couple of years old. Hot water was warm only..not a real problem CLEANING and Room makeup was only every SECOND day. Coffee ration was two packets...surely four…",2,December 2012
My family and I stayed here for some vacation this December. The hotel is quite average and the room space is average as well. Rates are relatively cheap and their staff is quite helpful. They have a nice pool out front and their dinner buffet is cheap and has a good selection.,3,December 2012
room is clean and ac is good.staffs are nice and acomodating.security is good.beachfront is clean and relaxing.what is just funny is the breakfast that you have to endure the same menu for the rest of your stay. maybe because its free. purga ka bay!,4,December 2012
"I am not impressed of the location especially the first rooms we were offered but they changed us to a room where we were able to stay together with four beds, but when you open the patio door, there was no view at all.  It was next to a staff cafeteria.  I woke up at 0500 this morning with staff noise.  I called four times.  The noise would subside but after 10 minutes, they would play loud music.  It was almost 0800 when the front desk personnel was able to stop them.  I did not sleep on my entire stay.  The swimming pool look dirty.  Breakfast is not appetizing.  Except for the noisy staff, majority of the staff are friendly and responded fast to our request.",3,December 2012

I got my booking through internet, Upon arrival in LA CARMELA DE BORACAY we are surprised because the hotel's policy is asking for a 2 thousand pesos deposit  I'm quite irritated  because its my 1st time to hear a hotel is asking for deposit in your stay even its already PAID. The hotel staff explained everything that if we check out we're going to refund the money , so I counted all the money that we needed because going to and pro in Boracay they have plenty of taxes to be paid and  we rented  a car to bring us back to Kalibo..for our flight to manila.

"Hi, The hotel staff are very friendly, environment are very clean. It was very much better than my expectation.I had booked 5 rooms with my group member and all of them enjoy the stay. The location is very good and it is beach front. Value for money.  Area to improve: it will be good to change the set breakfast to buffet as the set breakfast with rice is the morning is not suitable for others country taste.  Western breakfast will be good for all.",4,November 2012

We enjoyed our stay in your hotel and very much satisfied for the services rendered to my family.",4,November 2012
"At first I wanted to rate this place average because it really isn't that bad. But my reviews are based on whether or not I would return to this place. And sadly, the answer is no.  Because of it's very cheap price, a lot of people stay in La Carmela. Which means it can get cramped and noisy. I was with a group and we were admittedly a little noisy so I didn't mind this as much. However, for those who want a quiet, intimate vacation, it would probably be better to choose something else.  I supposed that for the price, the rooms weren't too bad. Except the room we got had a very musty, sour odor. The toilet was also broken. The next day, we had to move to a different room because the toilet simply wouldn't flush. The room they moved us into had a much smaller bathroom but I…",2,November 2012

The location was so good because since it is near from the beach.  Overall we were all satisfied during our stay in this hotel.",4,November 2012
From the moment we checked into this hotel it didn't feel right for us. Silly rules and regulations and overpriced extras make it like a school rather than a hotel. Staff needed to more focus on the customer. The Hotel is pretty clean and well postioned. The food is  provincial quality level. I am paying for good food not junk. If you are on a budget it is just okay but better places to stay eleswhere. Not recommended.,2,February 2012

Anyone can buy shampoo and soap they really need to fix the amenities showers are broken even the sink. they are very strict with their pool you need to wear swim suits only policy! :) Shirts and shorts are not allowed. in regards with the breakfast too It is expensive for the egg they alreadt call it as a buffet when you can only have egg, corn beef, some kind of…",3,October 2012

The food, drinks and service are great. Lots of people coming in and out every time but the hotel was kept clean at all times. The location of the hotel from the beach is very nice. They really are fronting the beach :) The room is clean and spacious!  Haven't tried the fitness center nor spa since we went there for the beach :) All in all, we loved our stay in this hotel. And we will not hesitate to choose them again in the future.  Many thanks for La Carmela de Boracay for a wonderful vacation we had! Celebrating my wife's birthday in your resort was really a good idea :)",5,November 2012
"We were going to book the Crown Regency but decided to give this dump a go, big mistake. The Hotel looked nice, no problem there. Check in was chaotic and disorganised. At check in I was going to leave as the receptionists looked confused. Yet for some insane reason I held in there and booked a room. My first request for a room with a view was not available then I was supposedly upgraded to an extra cost to a room without a window? At that point I should have left. Still like a fool I took the room and sure enough It looked like an attic room. The room was nice, small and the aircon worked but was awkward to get to. The bathroom was clean and everything worked. Down stairs was similarly chaotic, no chance of eating anything decent here. The breakfast looked good but was bland…",2,March 2012

"We are group of friends staying in the other hotel near La Carmela. One night, we decided to have a dinner at the resort. Some of my friends want to go swimming also. Since we are not in house guests of La Carmela, we tried to inquire first if they can allow us to go swimming in their infinity pool if we will have dinner (Ala Carte, not buffet), one of the staff said, it is not possible. But my friends are really eager to god swimming, so we asked another staff, the second staff said YES, that we can go swimming if we will order some food.

The very good thing about the hotel is their location, it is just stone throw away distance, food is average, but the staff is very cooperative and humble.",3,July 2012
"My wife and I stayed here one night sharing a room with two friends.  The hotel is typical of western style hotels, and the amenities are what you would expect from say, a Holiday Inn in the states.  Some of the highlights are a very nice pool (two actually), and a nice pool side bar with reasonably priced drinks.  Plus it's right on the beach and about a 10-15 minute walk from D Mall.  Given all the other options in Boracay, this resort may disappoint if you're looking for luxury.  But if you're booking a room for four, prices aren't much higher than any budget place on the island, and considering that, the Carmela is a really great value.",4,October 2012
"buffet dinner was really really bad. the free breakfast was cold scrambled eggs and watery corned beef. the semi deluxe hotel room was very basic - don't expect anything else coz its good only for keeping your bags. for the price of the rooms in a higher category, you can get better accommodations in Boracay.",2,September 2012
Good hotel very good massage service in the room.  Limited breakfast buffet but price is reasonable Although service staff doesnt know how to smile :( they offer shuttle service which cost around 575 per head but i suggest that you go straight to the office of the bus station their shuttle service with boat transfer from boracay to kalibo airport only cost 350 pesos which is way much cheaper.,4,September 2012
"CONS 1. Rooms were ugly. I booked a Quad room for 3 nights and paid around Php3,500 total.   2. Food was blah, so much that I did not use my complimentary breakfast the following mornings.   3. Customer service was terrible. I had a concern before going on my trip and it took them forever to pick up. The line (the number written on the booking confirmation) would just keep on ringing. They finally picked up after around my 15th try. 4. Pretty long walk going to D'mall. 5. They ask you to pay a deposit of Php2,000 upon check-in.  PROS I can't think of any. Sorry.",2,September 2012

The hotel is in a very good location, the rooms given to us were ok (our group occupied 3 rooms) with basic amenities like hot and cold shower, toiletries, safe, ref.  Don't expect a lot with the set breakfast though...With the amount we paid, La Carmela de Boracay has given us good value for our money...I will definitely recommend this hotel to friends and clients....",3,August 2012
"If you will spend most of your time hitting the beach or going around Boracay, then you won't mind the simplicity of the Hotel. It has all the basic things you need in your room - a bathroom, working AC, closet and a full cabled TV. Other than that, there's not much you can do there. They have wifi service in common areas and they also have a pool. Location-wise, it's fine though it's a bit far from D'mall and is not located in the classy cluster of Boracay. If you're on a budget, this hotel would be a great pick. They also have plenty of rooms and elevator for ease of access. For their price, it's definitely a bargain.

"Affordable since you get a good sized room for the price. Room has its own ref and there's even cable tv. Noisy cause you hear the conversation in the hallway. Unfortunately, we were placed at the floor dominated by the young crowd, hence, their late night noise kept us awake for two nights as well. Even my 8 year old daughter would wake up everytime a noisy crowd would pass by in front of our room. The hotel staff should be perceptive enough to book families with other families on the same section of the hotel, not mix them with the young crowd who smoke and enjoy late nights. I think this is just common sense.  Crowded, even on off season. You had to wait for a table during breakfast.",3,August 2012
"La Carmela is only popular because they offer high commissions to travel agents - easy money. So the travel agents only promote La Carmela, without thinking of their clients. Own pockets first. Clients' satisfaction onsite dosnt matter. But because it is ""cheap"", clients fall into the trap..And regret after... Look at the reviews  It is not normal that out of more than 300 reviews, only 10 think that it was excellent. And maybe those ""excellent""  reviews were written by the staff or friends (or free stays). Bad scores don't lie...  We were at La Carmela the last few days - and no way it shows the standards that a hotel should have. Very poor customer service. Poor maintenance. Too many rules. You feel like you are in a factory, a hospital..or even a school with all kinda rules…",1,August 2012
"The room was average but I did not like the bathroom. It didn't seem / feel clean. The towels were one of the worse (not soft and does not smell nice). Beach towels are to be rented (booo!). Our friend lost his money when they had their room cleaned, dishonest housekeeping. Not going back here, not safe, not clean.",2,February 2012
"Our barkada booked two standard rooms on La Carmela.  We got the packages from one of the Travel Fairs at SM Megamall.  The owner was at the fair and he was very accommodating to us.  I can't really say it this is a value if we got the regular prices, so I'll just point out what I liked about it.  For one, they have purified water dispensers around the place so you would save a lot instead of buying purified water all the time.    They also have their own pool (albeit small) which you can just dip on if you don't want to go to the beach.    The breakfast buffet is a value, not pricey but enough to get your fill of silogs with brewed coffee. I can't remember the price, but since a cheapskate like me availed it, then it must have been worth it :)  On the downside, the dining area…",3,September 2011
"As a couple we have been to this paradise island multiple times, but it was the first time for our 2 kids.  It was our eldest's 13th Birthday and took the chance to celebrate in Boracay. We were looking for a cost-effective accomodation, with beachfront and a swimming pool would be a plus.  La Carmela fit the bill.  We were able to take advantage of low season rates as it was in November.  We booked directly with the hotel months in advance to secure the booking.  Breakfast voucher was only for two, so we just paid for an extra plate. Check-in went smoothly as we were greeted by a welcome drink.  The room was enough for our needs and there was a walk-out balcony. We tried the dinner buffet on the 1st night - good volume but quite limited choices.  We tried the Mongolian buffet…",3,November 2011

That when booking the hotel  the person I spoke charged each person  for 13 adults plus the kids in detail in the receipt   and we had hard time talking to the staff and the supervisor on the morning of july 15 just to get a proper breakfast which we waited for them to decide 30min to an hour just to get food. and  before I forget the hotel promoted , standard to deluxe rooms max of four persons. so when you…",1,July 2012
"We stayed at La Carmela last December 2011 to meet with my foreign friends staying for Christmas.  The place is just ""ok"" for its price.  The rooms are a little small considering that we already avail the family room.  Some of the fixtures are not so clean and I think the resort needs renovation.  The staff are very accommodating though but there's not much to do in the resort.  Anyway, its Boracay and you have all the activities in the beach.  Their food is good and they offer dinner buffet from 6PM - 9 PM.  Their pools are small though and not so clean.    Overall I would say it's ok if you're looking for a budget friendly resort in Boracay that is near d mall, markets, outdoor activities and food tripping.  You will be staying more outside so it's a decent place to sleep into.",3,December 2011
"My cousin and I made reservations at this hotel for an executive suite. When we checked in on a Friday, they had no more executive suites left and they upgraded us for free to an ocean view suite. Nice. However, when we actually got to our room, an ""ocean view"" is relative. The hotel is facing perpendicular to the ocean so an ocean view is only visible through a trip out onto your tiny balcony. You really can't see the ocean when standing inside your hotel room. Also, the 2 beds in the ocean view room are a queen and a single. The single seems to be an afterthought in terms of what furniture to the put in the room: the single made the room so cramped we kept bumping into it on our way to the door. The vanity and closet are right in front of the door which I didn't understand…",3,August 2012

The hotel staff were very kind anf accommodating, however, we found it a little frustrating since we were supposed to be reserved in the rooms at the 2nd floor only to find out we were transferred to the attic area (which was not really convenient for our 3 elder company (mom, dad and grandpa).  The rooms we had were not equipped with enough toiletry supplies as the one provided (shampoo, soap, etc) was only for one person instead of 3 persons per room.

Very Relaxing to us and also the kids. Loved the Bed. Loved the pillows. My kids loved the 2 swimming pools. Breakfast not so bad. Good for 4. But me and my husband ate outside to explore good foods in Station 2.  We decided to extend our stay, so we moved to their Panorama Main Wing Room - Attic.  I was surprised coz there's a 4 single beds upstairs and 1 double bed downstairs. It was very very huge. My kids can even play hide and seek in their room. Even if we're in the attic. They have 2 service elevators.  We loved the ala carte foodie there.  Dislike: I dont like their location.…",4,March 2012

It’s on station 2 which is on the centre of activities, some lively bars are located nearby and nice beachside restaurants serve Filipino/asian food. Breakfast is included in the rate we pay, its edible but not a nice quality though-choices are limited. Check-in was fast as it was not peak season when we came so not too many people. Staff genuinely friendly.",3,December 2011

As more cheap , also it is not high standard resort but mostly we enjoyed the beach not by hotel. BUt if you will travel couples, that should be other hotel. Most private and high level quality. It is good only for barkadas and family. We had great time. Food wasnt so great but as i said we choose the cheapest. :) Enjoy Bora!",3,May 2012
"Situated in Station 2 of Boracay, a simple hotel was built beachfront. This is where water meet the entrance of the hotel premises  during very high tide.   This hotel has a small pool infront,which visitors may find they are loosing their privacy because anyone who walks in and out the hotel can see them. I didn't try their pool because i find it too small if a group of 20 people dip into it. Moreover, the hotel's restaurant is just beside the pool so anyone eating will have a feast on your swimming styles. :/   The rooms are ok and simple. oh well i guess we just took the room not on the ocean view; because for us, no need to take the ocean view whilst the most of your trip is your'e not occupying the hotel and you just spend the night in it.

Great hotel staff services, very friendly and accommodating. The only thing that i am not satisfied here is their bathroom with an annoying smell - dont actually know it is coming from, but i think its with the water supply. Buffet breakfast in not that something to be excited about, considering the price you've paid, this i think is just fine.  Overall, this is one of the practical beachfront hotels that I would recommend in Boracay, very much accessible and budget friendly.

Me and 11 of my friends stayed in La Carmela last week. Our team building budget was disapproved so we opted to stay in a cheaper hotel. Actually this is the 4th time ill be staying in La Carmela and I have also stayed in Boracay Courtyard (La Carmela Annex). The last time I stayed here was December 2010. I was just surprised because the hotel is so crowded to think that its off peak season. I was thinking maybe there are tons of guests in the hotel because they've been advertising all kinds of promos in coupon websites.   The room is okay but looks a lil old as compared to my last stay here. The pool is crowded and small. We ordered set breakfast since there are only 2 sets of breakfast per room. The food is okay but the serving is so small looks like a kiddie meal. Their…,3,June 2012

On our second night though, the bath started clogging and the water did not only spill onto the bathroom floor but out into the room! Our entrance was wet for hours.  Good thing though that when we discovered it late around after midnight, there was still hotel staff up to attend to it.  But it was only (almost) fixed the next morning when we were about to check out.  Service is also generally fair and of course location is good, except if you stay at the Executive building (like us) which is a 5 minute walk to the beach.

From booking offices to counter staff, to lazy on sight staff. (Chamber maids and waitors.) The worst thing is how they just ignore any request made by the guest.

I was not expecting much at all. Thankfully the whole stay was pleasant.  We arrived early but we got to be checked in at an earlier time than their 2pm check in time. The room was also clean and room service was done everyday. Their staff was also fast in heeding to my request specifically for a hair dryer.  We also requested to give our breakfast orders earlier than their 6am time so that by 6am breakfast would be served immediately for us to catch our early morning flight.

It was beach front so, I liked that. We stayed in the back side of the hotel so it was not as noisy as many people have mentioned. I stayed in the executive wing, it was quiet and cozy. The walk was a little further from the beach, but it was a max of 2 mins further... not a big deal if you prefer a quieter sleep.  It was super crowded by the front desk tho, just to get our luggage through was difficult because the people would stand around and not want to get out of your way. That was not a good experience, but its not necessarily the hotel's fault either. We did not spend a lot of the time inside the…",3,April 2012

They insisted that I did not ""coordinate"" in their manila office about the reservation and that Ensogo did not advise them of our reservation despite of me showing them Ensogo`s email of confimation for our reservation.

It's a little bit expensive to consider it as a budget hotel since the service, food and room amenities are blah to say the least. Their breakfast doesn't taste good and checking out takes forever. Restroom is small and their water is not that strong at times. I will not go back here, there are other inns that offer better service, good food and makes your vacation worthwhile.",3,August 2011

At the front desk, we were served powdered juice that should at least let us believe that it's freshly squeezed. It was too sweet. It took us a while to check-in the hotel. We were also asked PhP 1,000.00 per room for the deposit. I was expecting twice that amount as some travellers wrote.  So we found ourselves booking three rooms.

The room is just okay, service is excellent but the food is not so delicious at all. The egg is somehow raw, their adobo tastes like ginger! If you are travelling in Boracay to pamper yourself, La Carmel (Station 2) doesn't fit your vacation. We stayed in Station 2 primarily because the party is in here.

What I didn't like about this place was upon checking in they were asking us to deposit two thousand pesos which I found pointless.

"I get to stay at La Carmela because its included in the the online voucher my friends' purchased.  The room was spacious and enough for groups of four. Our other friends got the room beside us and they requested to have the connecting door opened. Coldness of the aircon was just enough but I really don't like the HARD PILLOWS! At first it was soft but when I woke up, it was not only me who had my neck ACHING. I don't like the lighting of the room because it does not give you a feeling of coziness. I suggest that they put on some yellow lighting and not all white bulbs.  I just have to commend the service staff. You can request for your room to be cleaned (one thing we needed if you have quite messy room mates). The voucher included two dinners and two breakfast which is quite…",3,February 2012
"We were dissappointed since our booked hotel was not only expensive but untidy, hence, we walked in at La Carmela reception for a last minute transfer & we got a very good deal.  Staff were all friendly and very helpful with everything. Very accessible & it's worth what we paid for that's why we managed to have almost all the activities at the beach.   Anyone looking for a hotel with great service for just anything, this is the one!",4,December 2011

The only rule I’ve set to myself is to not to expect anything so that I won’t get disappointed…and guess what?...everything turned out well. I won’t contest every little detail regarding 1. the room size (just ample not that big), 2. the comfort room (yes! No curtains that separate the shower area to the toilet), 3. the tv remote control (we have to ask 5 times! And only on the second day and after threatening the Housekeeping department of a possible complaint that they obliged to deliver) and 4. the buffet breakfast (very plain, not much of a variety)…those are all true!

"In the past, we usually enjoy exploring different hotels whenever we go to Boracay. There are hotels that are extremely expensive than the others. The first time we tried to book in La Carmela was 4 years ago, we have been returning to this hotel almost every year since it met our basic needs. The reason that we are going to Boracay is because of the beach and the sea foods, the hotel is just secondary.  The Good  - The hotel is located in front of the beach. - It has a restaurant, swimming pools and free WIFI in select areas. - It very close to several restaurants, including the Talipapa. - There is a BPI ATM near the hotel. - The room has basic amenities - Bed, a small TV with cable channels, a small safe, a mini ref, hot/cold shower. - The offer 2 nights + 1 night free during…",3,August 2011

Our stay:  Large room with mini fridge, air con - clean but did see coach roaches on occasion.  English TV - watched ellen and oprah  We didn't use the pool but it looked like it was mostly filled with children.  24 hour room service was great and they deliver beer (decent prices).  Food was terrible.  Staff was friendly.  Laundry service was great, only cost a couple bucks.  Felt very safe - security guards were outside of the entrances 24 hours.

"My third visit to La Carmella and first since 2009 and I was pleasantly surprise.  I had heard the renos were not cool, but the room was much nice, very fresh.  Mattress was a bit hard for me, but acceptable.    New front desk in off the side by the laneway leaves more room for inside dining, however I didn't avail myself of the food.  My friends did for breakfast and said the buffet was nothing special but not bad.  Biggest issue was service.  Any requests were granted with a smile, but never happened.  If there was a problem, they either didn't understand or denied that it was a problem.

Water supply is good, toilet shower could have provided a curtain (if they are saving cost) to avoid water from splattering in the lavatory area. Cleanliness of the hotel are acceptable, since it is expected to have some sands everywhere their facilities. Good Location (midway from Station 1 and midway from Station 3).

It was already a plan to see Boracay with them and someone from the Boracay Reality office recommended this resort for promo reasons.

Me and my wife stayed in room 147, and they had cockroaches in the bath room coming out of everywhere, the sink, the shower area.  We had to call house keeping everytime, and all they did was spray Baygon, and pick up the dead cockroaches.  What else can this lousy resort wannabe offer you?  Rude and unhelpful front desk, yucky breakfast, noisy hallway, this really makes it so hard to relax, and a wall full of pictures of the owner/CEO with different celebrities.

we stayed here for 5d4n together with my family and in laws. the room was quite ok and the price too coz my mom frequents there. for an average hotel this is ok.  the downsides are:  remote of the tv - will take u hours to get one. probably the last time they lost alot from their guests =) breakfast - the set menu is ok and to get a buffet just add P70 but the choices are very limited. room - i think they forgot to clean our room or they only have a few housekeeping to do it. we were gone for about 5 hours and our room is still unclean.,3,December 2011

Breakfast was traditional (rice, meat, etc) but also had fried eggs and toast which was great for us since we are used to an American Breakfast. The hotel grounds are spotless and there are staff everywhere to assist. The workers explained they are students doing internships. Their dinner was very good with Monogolian BBQ option.

Our stay here was a real bargain. Affordable considering that its at the beachfront of boracay island. Swimming pool is not that big but decent enough for some relaxation and enjoyment. One thing i dont like about la carmela are there reeptionists. They weren't so welcoming compared to others maybe because they receive so many guests in a day. And also they weren't so helpful when we ask for help about sea transfer since our travel agency indicated that sea transfer was included in our package.  There's a free breakfast included but its not that palatable. Room is not that big but is good for four people. I,3,October 2011
Chose this hotel mainly due to affordable rates. Hotel is in Station 2 and a leisure walk to Dmall takes around 15 mins. Not a problem if the weather is fine.  Room is large enough considering the affordable room rates. Had a room at the A (attic?) level so the ceiling was slightly sloping at the end of the room. There was no balcony. Room was quite sandy when we first stepped in but i suppose this is normal for a beach resort. There is a high step to the bathroom which makes it slightly non-child friendly. Ask for an extra key card in case you need the refrigerator running for 24 hours per day. I had to throw some food for my infant away since the refrigerator was automatically switched off when i took away the key card from the slot. Staff did not make up room even when the…,3,December 2011
"If you are on a tight budget and would want to burn calories by walking some distance, you can stay here. We decided to stay here because we got discount vouchers so that was okay. The rooms were small but it was not a big deal since we just plan to stay there to sleep. It was inconvenient though because most of the places we went to were in Station 1.

Out bathroom had a divider than only covered 1/3 of the shower area but the divider itself does not touch the floor, causing water to splash all over.

So anyway that was not too much of a big deal.

I even had a massage there and it was really soothing and calming especially since it was right in front of the beach.  Imagine having a massage with the sound of the waves and birds while the wind touches your skin....haaaaay!

But we were surprised that some people in the airport just made a simple call and we just waited for like less than 10 mins and the guys from La carmela picked us up already. They charged us p650/head roundtrip. But it was all worth it, the comfort and fast service. At the hotel, the usual welcome drinks, and then the bell boy took us to our room. Were a couple but the room assigned was good for four people. We requested for a room change, after waiting for less than 5 mins, we were taken to the newly furnished rooms located in the attic. It was better and a lot nicer than the older ones. The aircon was not that cold though, maybe it has something to do with the…",4,May 2011
"Had a not so good experience at La Carmela.  When our family went out to get some breakfast at their restaurant, I forgot something in our room so my husband went back and was surprised to see a Maintenance Guy just about to leave our room.  My husband asked him why did he entered our room and the guy told my husband that we were already checking out. My husband told him that we were not checking out yet so he asked him who told him that we were checking out.  So this guy, tells my husband that he was instructed to check Room 210 but our room is 215.  210 is far from 215. So we take this reasoning quite absurd.  So we reported this to the reception desk and was able to talk to the manager in the afternoon.  Though we got an apology, we will never go back to this hotel again.",1,August 2011
"Just got back from a trip to Boracay and stayed at La Carmela de Boracay Resort Hotel. On my arrival, the hotel staffs read the hotel policies, which, one of them would be that ""no hotel personnel may enter the guests rooms without the guests authorization.""  The next day when we were going out for breakfast at their restaurant, I told my husband that I forgot to bring the food stubs and it was in our room.  So he went back, and he was surprised to see a man --- hotel maintenance guy who is about to leave our room.  So my husband asked him, why did he entered our room.  The man replied that he was asked to check the room since we were already checking out.  My husband told him that we were not checking out and he asked him who gave him the permission to enter the room. So this…",2,August 2011
"It's my third time in Boracay, my first time to stay in Station 2.  I booked was able to get our hotel booking for Php 3000K plus for two nights.  That's such a bargain!  So, I wasn't expecting much really.    When we got there, they upgraded us to a Deluxe Room.  The room was okay.  The sheets, CR were clean.  AC, ref and TV were working just fine.    I didn't like the breakfast they served.  For the first day, they served us rice, this Hawaiian ham, adobo and breads.  For the second day, rice, corned beef, a certain pork dish and breads.  My husband keeps on telling me I should have lowered my standards considering the amount we paid for our stay.  I'm just saying if you are looking for good breakfast, this is not the place to check in.    They do charge one of the lowest…",3,August 2011
"I had read some terrible reveiws for this hotel, but my experience was totally the opposite. This hotel is looking to be full 100% of the time so offer great deals, the clientele are mostly native phillipinos, with a sprinklin of foreigners like me.  Booked hotel via Agoda for only $32.00 per night inclusive. Hotel right on the beach by boat station 2, right in the middle of all what goes on in Boracay, but away from any noise, perfect position. Hotel had its own medium sized swimming pool, together with cofee shop ( great selection of cakes) and hotel food service.

"I have never stayed in a more uptight hotel. I am not exaggerating. At check-in, they bombard you with all these house rules, on noise and henna tattoos. I made an effort to make the check-in staff realize that I didn't care - I just wanted to sleep and rest, but no - she went on and on about their rules. My gawd, this woman was clueless. These people should really make an effort to personalize their customer interaction. I really felt like I was being reprimanded.  At check out, this was a different staff - she was slow, confused, and made me wait for a good ten minutes before I could leave.  This hotel is good for its price. It's clean, breakfast was plain but acceptable, and it's at the beachfront. The major turn off for me was the staff - the management needs to look at…",2,July 2011

Upon arriving, we were greeted with refreshing drinks...The reception staff then informed us that since our booked room is not available we get to have a free upgrade. Instead of an executive deluxe for $40+ a night, we got a panorama jr. suite for the same price instead! It was perfect for us becoz we also have some friends that still need some place to stay.   I also like to point out that i appreciate the kindness of the hotel staffs. Full of smiles and ready to serve you.

We arrived in Iloilo at around 7 PM, stayed at a friend's house and headed to Sta. Ana terminal at 3 AM. Good thing there was an aircon Ceres bus that will depart at 4 AM. We were already in Tabon Port in Caticlan at around 10 AM.   We were surprised that a guy (forgot to get his name) from LGU (Dep't of Tourism, I guess) assisted us in deciding where to stay and even accompanied us to our hotel for us to get a 10% discount.

Stayed here with a family member. We were both guys and just looking to rest our head for the night. If you are that type of traveler that only stays in the room to sleep then La Carmela is great for the price. It is located far from the actions. Our room can easily fit 4 person because we had two queen bed. They do charge per person which I didn't claim my cousin was staying with me. It was ok because he just walked right in and the place is big enough that they can't keep up who the quest are. The hotel is really basic. You really get what you pay for.

It was pretty big, quiet, and had a bit of a balcony which got sun, so was good for drying stuff out. Everything worked, except we seemed to run out of hot water pretty quickly. Bathroom was big, though looking a bit old now. Food was average. Staff were generally helpful, security seemed ok, and we were able to check in and out quickly.

The pool is very nice and the beach is just a short walk away.  As opposed to other reviewers I was always greeted by the staff and they were helpful when requests were made of them.  The availability of many different excursions from touts and booths along the beach road made planning activities easy.  The touts weren't too pushy and a simple no to their entreaties was sufficient.

I've never been there, but I've been to many different beaches and this is the best of all.

First, they never answered to our emails and text messages so we had to call. One of our companions did the transaction but on the day we were supposed to send the deposit, we cannot reach the reservation officer who was in-charge of our booking.

The corridor which led to our room was poorly lit, actually creeped us out a bit, and the actual room was the same. Sure it was spacious enough for 5 adults as it had 2 big beds, which could be pushed together if needed, but the design was very basic.

The bedroom portion was ok, but the bathroom needs some work and was poorly lit.  The property was undergoing renovations while we were there.  However, they only seem to be taking place around the pool area and dining room.  The staff was friendly and helpful.  This was probably the hotel's strongest selling point.  However, I would not recommend this hotel to westerners.  It would be fine for visitors in their 20's, but not an older demographic group with higher expectations.",3,October 2009
"it was my first time in bora, so i was really looking forward to it. although the trip was long and tiring, when we arrived at La Carmela, we were greeted with hotel staff carrying refreshments, and that was a plus. The check - in time took a little while, but the room we reserved is great. complete with TV and cable, spacious, a nice bathroom, cabinets, and a safety deposit box for your valuables. also, i liked the fact that the staff really cleans the room when you put the 'clean the room' sign at your door knob. The hotel have two pools, and a restaurant, the food was okay but it would be no problem if you wouldn't like the food because there are tons of choices in that beach anyway.  I liked also the fact that they have an internet cafe and wi-fi service in the hotel, also…",4,April 2009
"We stayed for 2 nights at La Carmela last August 28-30, 2009.  Check-in was fast & smooth, as we arrived around 7pm already because of a delayed flight. The reception gave us a warm smile and some welcome drinks..which was nice treat since we were so thirsty.  It was also our luck that the hotel was full that we were upgraded to a VIP room.  Indeed, we were given a big room with two queen size beds, a terrace and a big bathroom with separate shower and a big tub (like a jacuzzi) with water heater.  But the design of the room is old style..needs a facelift.  Basic amenities were provided like towels, toothbrush, toothpaste, shampoo & lotion. No complimentary coffee/tea service though.  Cable TV was available but unfortunately no remote control (so hard to change channels)!! There…",4,August 2009
"We stayed in La Carmela from Aug.29 to Sept.1 (4days/3nyts). As we arrived there, they offered drinks.  The reception is ok. The room that we stayed is only a standard room with TV, 2 double beds, hot & cold shower and with crib (as I requested). The rooms might need some improvement. On our breakfast, they served buffet with mostly Filipino dishes.  They have their own swimming pool and it's a beach front hotel , so it's ok. But compared to Station 1, the location is not good. We walked 30 mins. to 45 mins. in going to the D'malls and Restaurants so its ok. The sand in Station 2 is not that good  and beautiful compared to Station 1. But, if you are in a Budget. This hotel suits for you. They are good in housekeeping and food services. They give you what you need in the hotel. …",3,September 2009

(great staff you have!! well done) I found this out to late while we where at the airport on the way to manila. I did not use my camera in boracay because I had left the charger in Manila. you might ask your self why there are 3 pawn shops in the ""town"" on this little island?? only for one reason to sell your stolen stuff!! so beware!!! you can never trust the people from those buget…",1,October 2008
"La Carmela had the amenities that we would need in a hotel. Location is good. My biggest complaint is the smell of the rooms. They are either not cleaned well or good air freshners need to be used. The bed linens and pillows are old and smell bad. Location is very good. The accomodation is over all good for the price that you pay. This is a good hotel for a bigger group, but I would probably pay a liitle extra at another hotel next time. The staff is somewhat slow and do not communicate with each other",3,June 2009

For me, I  have a great experience the time I was in their hotel, The employees are very accommodating and their management so far it may be competitive... but im not hundred percent sure of it!!! just kidding,  hehehe  try to visit  this hotel for you to find out !!!!",3,June 2009

"I arrived at this hotel about 12 noon and thankfully only had to wait a few minutes before a second floor room was made available.  The hotel has a 'split personality': the just opened rear section, away from the beach, looked to be of 2008 standard although its small swimming pool required finishing touches and filling; the older section fronting the beach seemed to be about 1973 standard, if that.  Walking along the dingy, long corridors gave the hotel an institutional feel.  I expected a 'prisoner' to opo their head out of a room and ask for some porridge.  This is an old-style hotel that believes in numerous signed rules first, and guests second.  The posted notices were too numerous to repeat here but a sample included that the rear old section lift operated only between…",2,March 2009

"I read the reviews before we left for Boracay and I already warned my mom about the noise in the corridors, run-down facilities, bad food, etc.  While it was true that the noise in the corridors are distracting, the bed linen was clean, although the pillows were too high and hard.  Cable TV was good.  Bed size and Room size was pretty good considering the price we paid per room (2,900.00 pesos  twin sharing, with breakfast).  The aircon was ok but i think that the heat just permeated through the balcony door so the room was not too cool.  Our balcony faced a high wall so it was only good for drying out our swimwear and not for sitting down and enjoying the breeze.

"La Carmela structure is very long, over 100 meters long and perpedicular to the beach.  The lighting is very dark and yellowish.  The hotel is adding more rooms in the back.  If you have a room in the ""back 40"" you will pass through so many doors in the dimly lit hallways.  It just does not give anyone a sense of security.  They do not have security cameras.  Someone can just pull you into their room at night and no one would know.   We arrived in our room and the floors were full of dust.  I took my shoes off and started changing clothes when I noticed my footprints.  The bottom of my feet was blackened by the dirt.  My wife called housecleaning and the boy showed up with an old mop.

My wife and I had put t-shirts on our pillows on the second night  We ended up here on a recommendation from a family member in the Philippines, and there were alot of locals there as well, so maybe it's popular for locals.  I don't think that it meets western standards though.  The main problem was the bathroom, which did have alot of ants in it, and was really run down.  It made you feel like you had to wear shower shoes in it.  They also don't come and clean your room, you have to request it.  Also the towels are paper thin and seem like their 10 years old.

The bathrooms need to be redone. The water pressure was very low in the showers. There were also tons of little gnats flying around the bathroom. The beds, however, were very comfortable.   The rooms are non-smoking but each room has a balcony for the smokers. But, don't expect a view. All you see is a brick wall.  They serve a breakfast buffet that is pretty good. I don't eat beef or pork so I was very limited to what I could eat. They also have a dinner buffet on the beach which is really nice. They have a greater selection of food for dinner.

There was hardly hot water available, or just  water for that matter.  The breakfast served was mediocre and the dinner was the same thing every night.  My mom got stuck in the elevator for over an hour and none of the alarms worked.  If we had not searched for my mom and if not for my uncle who heard her screaming in there, she would have fainted inside due to the heat and humidity.

Hallways were dark and very loud at night you can hear every person walking through.  Their buffet was awful. Their mongolian style BBQ took too long -30 min wait for your food. The dinner location was not too bad-Beach front. Service from staff was good but overall this hotel was trashy looks like a motel 6 in the US which I dubbed "" the dumpster "" This Hotel deserves maybe a 1 rating. Do not stay in here unless you are on a tight budget and will not use rooms except to sleep/crash. You need to be exhausted or drunk to sleep in room.",1,March 2008

I can understand if such room has views but all room don't have views except for the super suite which is only 4 of them.  All rooms from there are all just motel type.  They are either overlooking an ugly roof of the next establishment or the walkway to the kitchen of the hotel, which by the way reeks some smell.  On the otherside of the building the views are either a wall and very dirty area or a next building window which is about only 2 feet away....honeymooners beware!!! people on the other side can actually peep or listen into your room.

It was clean and the best part, it had running hot water!!!  I’m a stickler for the bathroom’s being clean.  Its one of the first things I look at when booking a hotel.  The bathroom, although not much the shower stall had either mold/rust on the bottom but since it was so minor I didn’t complain.    We actually booked a total of three rooms but later my brother in law upgraded to a family suite instead.

"The hotel is quite good, with decent size rooms, but the deluxe rooms aren't really deluxe - just average.  There are no views of the beach (unless you get the penthouse suite) and the main pool area is a little bit small, but the hotel is located in a great place - pretty much central along the beach.  Most things are nearby - tons of restaurants (including on the beach), and the Tourist Info building is about 2 buildings away.  Most of the accommodation we saw looked pretty nice... I don't think you could go too wrong in Boracay. It's a lovely island, although it takes a bit of effort to get there, but of course, its worth it.",3,February 2008

First off our travel agent guaranteed us a oceanview room but there aren't any oceanview rooms at this resort.  The rooms were dirty and grimy looking, the bathroom had moldy spots, there was a hole in the ceiling and the best part of the room was the view.  We were in rooms around 1315 & 1317.

So, when i got to La Carmela I wasn't surprised when the place looked worse than  a motel 6.  Our room was tidy, clean, no super clean but it sufficed, but the bed sheets were thin and rough and the furniture looked worse than what you'd find at Salvation army.  For $90/night I thought maybe that's the high price you pay for staying on an island that's so beautiful.  The hot water wasn't very hot, but it's Boracay, I was ok with luke warm water.

The place is too high priced for what you are paying for during peak season. There are many cabins, cabanas, and other higher quality resorts available on the beach for much less. 2. The place is more a Filipino style hotel. If ya had a group of people to share a room it is OK.  3. The place is too noisy. While there, there was a TV production company and a movie company staying there and it was quite noisy. 4. There are too many vendors hanging out side the hotel entrance.

"This place was quite a disappointment. In fact we spent much of our vacation eyeing up other hotels, comparing prices and wishing we had stayed elsewhere. We even checked out 2 days early to spend the remainder of our stay at a romantic little place we found. To sum up, the place was very shabby. Linens were very poor quality, beds uncomfortable. The general standard of service was poor, and the location was unpleasant -  on the shabbiest part of the beach, with lots of vendors. And there was something unmentionable floating in the pool and when we mentioned it to the staff they only laughed!

I paid $90 per night and it's worth about $35 per night.  We were put in a semi-deluxe room on the 3rd floor and the ceiling started leaking.  There's an attic upstairs and it rained very hard the night before.  So we requested a different room.  When we got to the new room, the telephone was not working.
