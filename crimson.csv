"I have been coming back to Crimson over the past few years because of its amenities but this year, customer service has just been stellar! It was my birthday and as early as port arrival, the staff were already greeting me! I even received a surprise lava cake with a birthday greeting inside my room. :) and when I booked Azure‚Äôs private room for my birthday dinner, the staff surprised me with a birthday greeting on the wall! Amazing stuff! Thank you so much, Crimson! I want to mention the following staff who are noteworthy to be commended please: Azure - Beejay - he has been my go-to since a few years back, he takes care of my needs whenever I‚Äôm at the Azure resto, over by the pool, or even at the beach! Ran John - he, together with the staff, gave me a birthday greeting surprise in Azure‚Äôs private room Joshua - this lifeguard isn‚Äôt only a lifeguard but has amazing customer service as well. He was accommodating and even ran to give me a towel because he thought I might be feeling cold coming from the beach Ray - from Safron. He has got to be the most genuine and sincere staff there. It‚Äôs the way he carries himself and talks to people that makes him stand out from the rest of the staff Ray - from Concierge. I didn‚Äôt meet him personally but chatted with him re: the airport transfer. There was a typhoon and we had a senior with us who didn‚Äôt want to take the speedboat. Ray patiently explained to me that we will be taking the land transpo for our safety.  Roa - from the port. She was the first one to greet me a happy birthday and was so sincere doing so.  There‚Äôs one more staff I want to commend but I wasn‚Äôt able to get his name. He‚Äôs a tall man, wearing eyeglasses, from the front desk. He was so friendly and accommodating to me and my family.   Thank you again, Crimson. See you next year, on my next birthday! üíì‚Ä¶",5,June 2023
"Been to Boracay countless times, and Crimson is one of the best hotels for me.  They have a nice lounge in Caticlan with cookies. There is even wine!  Stayed in a one-bedroom suite. It was huge, especially the bathroom. A part of oir group stayed in the villa with plunge pool. Villa guests have access to the Villa Hoir at Mosaic. You can enjoy afternoon treats and drinks.  Nice breakfast spread. Lots of choices!  They have shuttle service to D'mall. If you take the e-trike, expect to pay 250 to 350 pesos one-way.",5,June 2022
We had an amazing time in Crimson. Impeccable service from staff. Room and facilities were first class. Location was perfect and everything just felt special. We enjoyed our stay and would love to come back again. ,5,May 2023
My partner and I had a short stay at the resort in May. We booked a pool suite with a lovely sea view and enjoyed our time relaxing and dining on site. The food was great and the staff were amazing. Cyra at mosaic restaurant and both Roge and Vincci at the concierge desk were super helpful. Definitely booking another stay in the future.,5,May 2023
"We've been to several countries and hotels but never felt compelled to write a review..  But after our stay in Crimson, it just feels strange not to give one, because once I instantly recall how happy my family was, I know I should express at least a rightful appreciation..  There's something really exceptional about Crimson. We knew that the place and all its stuff would be wonderful, but suprisingly, what impressed us the most was the Service.¬†  Their stellar staff intuitively knows your needs and would offer all-out help to resolve any of your significant concerns, from the reception, area facilitation, accommodation, and even on send off. Aside from being courteous and sensible, they gave us all the necessary assistance and even favors that simply made us feel special.  It was a well-served experience for us,  we know for a fact that sometimes, even our vacations come with few hassles and problems. And it's really helpful to have this kind of team to assist you and ensure that you will still enjoy your precious vacation.  We got to enjoy all the items and experiences during our stay, and my family was so delighted. Needless to say, we gave Crimson a perfect 10 rating. My son, who is very hard to please, even gave it a 4 thumbs up ..¬†  (yes, toes included üòÑ)‚Ä¶",5,May 2023
"It was my son's birthday celebration, we needed it to be perfect. And thanks to you and your team, it was! Your staff treated me like family. Drivers and other staff especially Sir John gave us the warm receptiveness and ofcourse Sir Rey's of Saffron's Cafe gave us extra ordinary service and kindness. They made sure first day of my son's birthday celebration at your hotel a memorable one. Our dinner at Mosaic Restaurant  was marvelous. There‚Äôs no way I would forget the warmth and kindness you offered my family and me.Thank you for your excellent hospitality; it surpassed my expectations.  I want my friends and family to have the kind of experience we had with you, so I will gladly recommend you.Please keep up the good work. You have a life-long customer in me.",5,May 2023
"We had two rooms at the Crimson Boracay in May, traveling with my fianc√© and her family. The facilities and location are wonderful, but the service is not even worthy of a 3 star resort much less a 5 star  Let‚Äôs start with the bad - The aircon in my room did not work properly. The room stayed over 24degrees (77 Fahrenheit) the entire time. They sent someone to fix it, he finally left and said he would ‚Äúcheck the chiller settings,‚Äù but it did not improve. I will give them credit that they called and checked and when I said it was not fixed sent someone to change the thermostat. We left for the day, coming back to the room late to find it still over 24 degrees. So for two nights I got very little sleep because being from Wisconsin this was miserably hot to me.  - I purchased a number of extras when I made my reservation and when I tried to ask about them when checking in, the clerk knew nothing. Their entire process is to get your Viber or WhatsApp and message you. This is what you have to do for anything you want/need. Very impersonal - They seem to add an 8.5% service fee to everything with no explanation. For example, I availed of the private speedboat transfer which it said online was approximately 16K, but then they added 21% more for taxes and the 8.5% service charge. - The food at breakfast was good but service is terrible. One morning there were no juice glasses. I told three different people and they were not replenished. Finally the lady behind the bar area gave me a glass. It takes forever to get your coffee and then no one comes by for a refill. You have to fill out a form at the egg station vs. just telling them what you want like other hotels.  - I asked the desk clerk about activities like parasailing and was again directed back to Viber. Very unhelpful . By the way, do not do parasailing thru the hotel they mark it up over 4X what it costs if you go to providers at Station 1 - I asked the Concierge about how long it took to get to a certain place and how to get an e-trike. He seemed to have no idea where I was talking about at first even though it‚Äôs  a very popular activity. I finally had to show him pics then he understood. His English was terrible and this is a concierge at a 5 star resort.  - I asked about horseback riding in the island and they had no idea. I later found out on my own another hotel offers horseback riding and it‚Äôs open to the public for a few, but by the time I discovered it myself no reservation was available. - There are shades on the floor to ceiling windows and these are power with buttons to control them on a nearby walk. They did not seem to work as planned, one would auto go up when you pressed the button but the others you had to stand and hold them the entire time‚Ä¶seemed like it took forever, making a simple task a chore - Called for a bellman to help with our luggage and he showed up without a cart - I was paying for both rooms, but they INSISTED at the end that my fianc√©‚Äôs mother had to sign the bill for the second room. - I paid nearly $300 for our buffet dinner one night and asked the server for the bill, which I paid and left a healthy tip. Then as we are walking out, right in the middle of the floor the manager confronts me telling me I need to pay. This is embarrassing as we are literally in the middle of the restaurant between the diners and the singer. When I tell him we already paid, he doesn‚Äôt apologize but instead starts looking to his staff for confirmation like I‚Äôm a liar. How‚Äôs that for service after dropping $300 on dinner!!!! - Be careful on the bathroom tile. If it gets even a little wet it‚Äôs super slick. Very dangerous  - I paid 19K pesos, about $380, for the private speedboat transportation back and forth. First, the lady at the welcome pavilion had no idea we had paid for the return trip as well and tried to sell it to me. Then they offered everyone coffee when it‚Äôs over 99 degrees out. I asked if they had cold drinks available and an employee listed a number of cold drinks. I said I would have Gatorade and he then wanted to charge me 150 pesos ($3) for a bottle of Gatorade!!! Mind you I‚Äôm paying $380 for this transport package and they can‚Äôt even provide a cold drink.   The Good: - We took the art class for adults on a rainy day and it was so much fun. The teacher was great and really made it enjoyable. Well worth the money - Their private Transport package is expensive but worth it. The Welcome Pavilion is great (other than the cold drink issue mentioned above) and the staff there and on the boat were fantastic. - The room was nice, but the balcony is really small - The main pool is large and did not feel crowded even on Saturday.  - The foam party was fun for adults and kids. I was actually surprised because I thought it would be silly, but it was great - Their beach is nothing short of paradise. This is so different than for example Station 1. It‚Äôs a very wide sand beach, completely secluded, perfectly clear water and it wasn‚Äôt at all crowded during our entire stay. There were plenty of lounge chairs as well. I do wish someone from the bar would come and let you order drinks, we always had to go to the bar to order, whether on the beach or at the pool. - The food quality was great. The dinner buffet at Saffron Cafe was expensive but worth it. Lots of choices and they grill a variety of meats to order. The selection changes nightly but always delicious. They also had live music both nights we were there, which our family really enjoyed. I will call out Paul from the wait staff‚Ä¶overall service was not good, but he was impressive. I‚Äôve been traveling to the Philippines for 20 years and this was the best dinner buffet I have experienced. - The overall facility is well maintained and the decor throughout is good. - The hats and bags provided were a real luxury touch that was unexpected. Very nice.  Overall the facility is 5 Star, but the service was unacceptable. I usually go to the resorts on Mactan which have outstanding service. The Crimson has something they can never have with it‚Äôs amazing location, but they waste it with poor service.‚Ä¶",2,May 2023
"We have just spent 4 nights at Crimson Resort in Boracay.  The hotel is beautiful and the staff amazing, not a single staff member walked past you without a smile and acknowledgement.  Our room was a standard room is Aqua (1214) and it was plenty big for the 2 of us with lovely king bed, lovely linen, good air on and ceiling fan, beautiful bathroom and great wi-fi right throughout the resort, even on the beach.  The private beach and pool are wonderful as is the foam party we experienced.  Happy Hour each afternoon between 4-6pm at the Azure Beach Club offers half priced drinks.  Breakfast each morning offered a good choice of local, asian and western.  The hotel offers shuttles buses to station 2 4 times per day although the van only seats 11 and it‚Äôs first come first serve.  This is my downfall for Crimson, for a hotel with 100 odds rooms to only offer this service 4 times per day for such little numbers is not sufficient.  Station 2 & 3 are where the nightlife and people watching occurs and it is not possible to walk there.  Alternately you can catch a tricycle for $250 peso but guest shouldn‚Äôt be asked to pay that.  A great experience, the hotel and staff are great, we would definitely come back.‚Ä¶",4,May 2023
"overall the stay are nice, with nice breakfast, swimming pool and beach area. We stayed in with 3 adult and 1 kid, the suite are spacious with set up of sofa bed at the living room. Breakfast are with asian cuisine, japanese, korean, filipino, and west. ",5,May 2023
We had a great time especially the kids enjoyed it. So many activities for the kids. We went back for a day trip  the day after we transfered to station 1 because the kids does not want to leave. The food was also good. Best part is the people. Great service and very accomodating.,5,May 2023
Best sunset view I‚Äôve seen. Clean hotel and helpful staffs. Smooth transfer from airport to hotel and back. Everyone in the hotel go extra miles in what they do. Food is good and lots of selections.  ,5,May 2023
"We had a magical stay at Crimson Boracay this week. Why? - the staff are proactively helpful, asking if they can slice a whole apple I grabbed at breakfast, to pool staff asking if they could help us take our photos - Ver and his team at Azure Beach Club (restaurant and bar) provided excellent food/drink recommendations. Food was amazing. Ver went above and beyond to make our experience special - The private beach on the property is exceptional. Probably the best we've ever been to, and we've been to Hawaii, Mexico, even Bali. Soft sand. Water is clear. The Shangri-la's beach is sadly nonexistent, rocky, and not inviting. - Saffron Cafe breakfast. Taste of food and service was incredible. Get yourself an iced latte! - Room.

The restaurants serves delicious and fresh food and drinks We had the most wonderful vacation we could ever dream of.",5,April 2023
"Let's start from the beginning and with the positive-- the arrival via land and boat transfer was very easy and felt very lux. The beach is incredible and has the luxury of beach chairs (which are not available at many of the other resorts in Boracay due to local rules). The food at the buffet breakfast was good, as was the lunch offerings on the beach. The room was well appointed. I also have to give kudos to the water sports coordinator for suggesting a superior tour guide that organized private island hopping.   The reasons for giving this visit a 3 out of 5 are many.  This was not a 5 star experience and the price was only worth it for the beach.  Some things were out of the hotel's control that negatively impacted our trip-- internet went out and power was out in much of‚Ä¶",3,April 2023
"This was our second time at the Crimson Resort. We are so happy that we returned. We love the beach, the room and the food in the various restaurants is great.

"The beach front is beautiful, the staff friendly, and the experience luxurious! It‚Äôs great for old couples & young families. I only wish it was closer to Station 2.  I wish there were more shuttles available within the day. Still, I enjoyed breakfast buffet at Saffron, dinner at Mosaic, the foam party at the main pool & the gym.",4,April 2023
"This property is more about functions than being an exotic beach resort. They had a function for 70 - 200 people on 5 out of the 7 nights we spent here. The people coming for functions outnumbered the regular guests at all times.  Some of the function crowds were noisy during the day. You needed ear plugs to sleep most nights.  We went to the Shangri-la after 7 nights here and we could  their party noise at night 700 meters away.

"This is our second time in Crimson and we love the beach and the pool. The food is good too. There's really no need to go anywhere else when we're in Crimson.  The staff are great too especially the ones near the pool. During the  foam party which usually happens on a Saturday, my kids joined in the fun. But my little boy struggled in the foam. It's a good thing the lifeguard were on watch and this lifeguard quickly fished my boy out of the pool, and while I tended to my son to make him feel comfy, he watched over my daughter in the pool to make sure she's safe in the foam. What would have been a scary event, was saved by their quick lifeguards. You're sure to have a fun and safe stay in Crimson! Thank you , Crimson!",5,April 2023

To sum it up, Crimson Boracay truly impressed us and will be our go to every time we return to the island.    The staff was attentive and genuinely kind. Service was quick and efficient. Food and drink are highly recommendable (Azure in particular is deserving of its accolades. I was there last year, and I have to say, the quality is still top notch). And the arrival and departure experience were top level. It definitely makes a difference in setting the tone of the guest's stay.  Big thank you to Roger and Third!

In our previous hotel we loved that you was always offered ice water whilst sat around the hotel, towels wrapped round you soon as you exit the pool and just remembering your name.

While there were only few available, the use of kayak and paddle board was free.  For me, best time to go out is early morning. Our Deluxe Hillview room was very clean and with sufficient space for family of 4. All drinks we found inside the room were all free and nespresso capsules were also provided.

I loved arriving by boat to the beach dock, being greeted by each and every staff member anytime we crossed paths, and the convenient shuttle to station 2 and d'mall. Architecture is breathtaking but sometimes formal over functional, like the bathrooms having only glass partitions between toilet, shower and bedroom (lacking privacy). Ram was our angel at check-in, Ray welcomed us every morning in Saffron Cafe, Mark at the pool bar doing the most with only one blender, and HAZEL at the Aum Spa.

"I love everything about Crimson Boracay... from the moment i made my booking, up to the moment they dropped me off back to Caticlan airport. The total experience was just remarkable! Hassle-free travel from airport to their welcome lounge to the receiving area at the resort, the wide variety of daily breakfast at Saffron, the very comfortable bed and pillows, the spacious room and bathroom with complete toiletries (i love their body wash), the pool and exclusive beach where you can chill all day long and enjoy their happy hour, their daily shuttle to Station 2, their helpful, friendly, courteous and accommodating staff and managers (shout out to Roger  Manuel and Ray Pingolio who really made sure I was always attended to). Thank you Crimson for the wonderful experience. Will‚Ä¶",5,March 2023
"It was an outstanding vacation and a perfect resort to relax, without being too far away from the city center in Boracay. Everything I could expect was at least matched if not excelled. Outstanding service, beautiful beach and prime facilities plus some special events on-site (BBQ at the beach, foam party funny not only for kids)",5,March 2023
"Loved our stay! The size was fantastic, location was amazing and facilities were great. The best view from our room overlooking the pool and the beach and service was excellent, everyone was friendly and kind. Food was wonderful and the hotel was very well kept, the room immaculate.

"Everything about this place was superb, from the well-thought of facilities, to great food selections, and amazingly friendly staff. It is commending how attentive the entire crew is - keeping it consistent to ensure we get a pleasant stay and trying to address our needs. The privacy and serenity of the place are a gem. From the very start of the experience of airport transfers, to the warm welcome in the holding center, even the boat transfers where the lads were very assistive and kind, til your stay in the resort, all remains consistent with the stamp of crimson - guest satisfaction. Definitely looking forward to going back to this new tradition we'll drfinitely keep doing. And cheers to the compli sweets for my birthday celeb!",5,March 2023

"Boracay, my dream island. My dream resort there.  The wonderful correspondence starts from the moment you get off the airport. Without paying the entrance fee to the island, we were directly picked up by a car. They collectively settle the bill when you check out of the hotel.  Normally they would take a fast boat directly to the resort, but the waves were so high that day that we went to the nearest port and drove to the resort from there. Safety first.  The accommodations are very spacious and luxurious. The views from the rooms are also wonderful.  The beach and pool are completely private and very relaxing. Boracay is world famous, so stations 1, 2 and 3 are full of people even on weekdays. I would recommend station 0 for a relaxing stay.  The staff and their smiles were‚Ä¶",5,February 2023

"The Crimson Boracay was 5 stars all around. Their location in station zero was incredible. Beautiful views, secluded from all the hustle and bustle of downtown and a white sand beach with crystal clear water. The resort is beautifully designed and maintained. The view from our room was incredible. The restaurants on the property do not disappoint. The food and drinks were all exceptional. The breakfast buffet rivals the best buffets we have ever been to in the US or Europe. Most importantly, their people are also 5 stars. Boboy, Arth, Francine, Joy, Eli and Hazel are incredible people. So friendly and amazing service. There was not a person we spoke that was not smiling and appreciative of us being there. Can‚Äôt wait to go back again.",5,March 2023

Our trip was super memorable!",5,March 2023
"The hotel is at Station Zero. It is perfect as they have their own beach. We had room with ocean view - fantastic! The hotel is 5 years old. Good location, choices in breakfast, choices for dinner as there are a few restaurants, entertainment for kids, reliable shuttle service to the town.  Negatives: a lot of miscommunications between staff in restaurants and reception. Our room was getting clean daily but at the end cleaning service slowed down. Was very noticeably. The balcony got cleaned once only! Watch how drinks are made in happy hour as you can receive half glass of wine instead of standard portion glass of wine‚Ä¶  However, overall it was a good stay!",4,February 2023

All smiles from everyone which was an answered prayer because we really wanted to give than a luxurious vacation and we achieved that. Thanks to the amazing staff of Crimson from airport to the private lounge to our our villa -- everything was such breeze and with much comfort. Amazing breakfast, great cocktails selection and wonderful birthday surprises as I was celebrating my birthday too.   Whenever we needed something, the guest services joyfully indulged. No request was too difficult, they always managed to work it out. We will definitely come back!   You're the best Crimson team! ",5,February 2023

"Having gone to Boracay several times, Crimson instantly became my favorite resort hotel by far. Everything went really smooth despite traveling with kids and toddlers during pandemic, and we did have a great and relaxing time.  Check-in: One of the things I liked is that our booking already included private transfers from airport directly to the hotel. The van that picked us up looked new, the waiting area for the boat is really private and served coffee and snacks with an amazing view, and the boat went straight to Station 0, at Crimson's beachfront, no other transpo needed. We were accommodated early as we arrived 8am and availed the early check in rate with buffet breakfast.  Rooms: We booked the suite with private pool, and we really enjoyed how our own pool had a shade so‚Ä¶",5,March 2022

Many thanks to Vinci who manage all the transfers and local transports for his open to support mindset. The restaurants inside the resort are very friendly , food delicious and tasty, but the pupils are very very warming, friendly, polite, respectable, willing to help and support you. This facility gives you a comfortable , safe and happy feeling.  Do not forget about the private beach and clear blue water.",5,February 2023
"Our Crimson experience is definitely felt in a heartbeat. The room is clean and modern. Special thanks to Jason and Rene for making every room tidy and pleasant. The staff were able to pull off the surprise for my partner. Even though it was a simple video, which included our family photos, it was made with a personal touch. They also put up conventional yet beautiful decorations and readied a delicious birthday cake for my partner to welcome us on our stay. Everyone in my family enjoyed their stay and had a great time during dinner by the beach that was beautifully set up by the staff of Crimson. Overall, we had a great stay in your hotel and we will definitely come back.  ",5,February 2023
"What a great experience! A lovely resort at Station Zero in Boracay. Well equipped and clean rooms. But the most important was the friendliness and welcoming attitude of all the staff.

The resort had its own private beach and dock. My friends and I took an e-trike (‚ÇΩ250.00 one way) to station one to check out restaurants and stores. It was a very short ride. If you want to spend a few days in paradise, I highly recommend Crimson Resort and Spa.",5,February 2023

The staff, the food, the room, the pools, the facilities, and the amenities made our overall experience absolutely delightful! The location offered the isolation we wanted for our escape from the city, but it was equally convenient for us to enjoy the vibrant island life of Stations 1-3.   We have been recommending Crimson to our friends. But as with all things, there is always a downside. In this case, that the experience ended too soon.",5,February 2023

He barely remember our last visit to Boracay which made me worried that he won't enjoy it this time but to my amazement, he did not only enjoy it, he wanted to stay, for good!  Staying in the Villa may have its perks, which we enjoyed a lot, but we are most appreciative of the service. The sincerity and authenticity in the service made a lot of difference, and its consistency all through out our stay proves the quality of service Crimson Boracay's management provides.

"My family of 2 adults and 2 young children ages 9 and 3, just had an amazing holiday at the Crimson Boracay! We stayed for a week in one of the villas with a plunge pool. Honestly, when we arrived the Villa did not have a wow factor. It felt small probably becuase of the lay-out. Pool is also small. We are used to staying in suites as we always need bigger space for the children to enjoy. The villa was clean though and well-maintained. It‚Äôs also few steps away from the main pool and the beach.  The service made up for that missing wow factor!

We were successful in depositing good/unforgettable memories in our family emotional bank account, and THANKFUL to CRIMSON BORACAY.   Some key highlights of our stay: 1. Pre-ordering of our lunch option upon arriving at their exclusive boat station.  2.

The value is exceptional double the size of a suite, private plunge pool, cocktails and canapes every afternoon between 3pm-5pm and by far the best breakfast buffet on the island. Breakfast goes until 11am so by the time you have breakfast venture out for a few hours and come back for cocktails and the amazing delights the chef prepares each afternoon you don't need lunch.

From the managers, to floor staff, greeters, waitress, lifeguards, and housekeeping. And the few and far in between that makes the whole Crimson Resort worth talking positively about to everyone. Again our concierge Mr. IVAN was quite welcoming with his infectious smile and his comforting personality that you can easily gravitate to.  He made our week stay there worth the memories and made it our place to continue to visit for many more getaways.     Crimson resort spa holds a very place for us now.

The service is impeccable and the food is SPECTACULAR. The overall feel of the place is elegant but homey. I could not have picked a better hotel for my family's first trip to Boracay.   Their pavilion at Caticlan (where we board the speed boat transfer to the hotel) is in itself a treat. I was disappointed we couldn't stay longer than 10 mins. They serve refreshments and cold towels when you arrive from a flight. They also had cookies in jars. I saw from one review they actually also serve wine there - why didn't I get some??

By then the seniors in our group (as was everyone else) were really hungry and they could not even accommodate us to provide some sort of refreshments at least.

"Crimson is such a lovely resort with very helpful staff. Special mention to Iza who was very alert to our needs.  We stayed in a villa which was very spacious and equipped with modern amenities. That said, there are some areas that the resort can work on-- shortening intervals between cleaning of washrooms in Azure and the ones beside it as they could be smelly and untidy, orienting guests more thoroughly regarding housekeeping policy (e.g. we were not told that if valuables like  laptop were left the room would not be cleaned), ensuring the room is really clean (our bathtub had a couple of what looked like soda spills) and making sure that communication sent via text does not contain contradictory information.

Now that we're able to stay here, I can say that it didn't disappoint. Seaview Suite was great. Staff were friendly.  The only thing I can complain about is that I thought we were arranged a hotel transfer during our departure to another hotel (Shangri-la, just next door), I think airport transfer is included but not hotel transfer?

"The resort is beautiful and the layout is very open. It‚Äôs easy to navigate the property. The check-in staff (especially Rex) were all very helpful and pleasant.   The room was gorgeous. I thought the window into the bathroom was pretty neat. I do wish the glass surrounding the toilet was frosted for extra privacy. The bed was plush as heck. I was disappointed that no ocean view rooms were available, though, as the hillside isn‚Äôt very pretty. We kept our blinds closed the whole stay. I would highly recommend spending the extra money to get an ocean view room if available.  The course meal at their on-site restaurant Mosaic was delicious. I have attached photos for that. 10/10 would recommend if they have one available on your stay. The breakfast buffet was likewise as enjoyable.‚Ä¶",5,December 2022

"It was the best decision we made as a couple, to get wed in paradise, and we call it Crimson Boracay.  It wasn't our first time here but our next visit came out to be the most special day of our lives. When we were just planning and in the process of negotiation, we didn't expect that Crimson will be able to meet our demands especially that we wanted the New Year's Day of 2023 (January 1) and yet they are able to give that spot to us. Our beach wedding was made possible!  Crimson Boracay has a very special place in our hearts now so we'd like to thank the whole management and staff of the resort for going over and beyond. Thanks for welcoming our whole family to Station Zero, for providing us a very welcoming service. From the people from the concierge department who fetch us‚Ä¶",5,December 2022
"Crimson is a lovely resort.  The New Year's Eve buffet was very good with many options.  The staff were lovely and very helpful especially Ian and Michael from the front desk area. Recommendations would be: Screens so outside air and breezes could be enjoyed without the concern of mosquitoes Adjustable beds, split kings so one person could sleep slightly elevated and the other person flat.   This is very helpful with older people and pregnant ladies.  Also fix that one section of the road going into town from dirt and pot holes to paved and smooth.",5,December 2022
"The place is so magical, all the hard work to save for this vacation is all worth it. Waking up in the morning with the view of the beach at your window is  like a dream.

"We recommend this resort for couples, family reunions, company conventions.  The resort‚Äôs  entire staff(from arrival to departure) were very welcoming, courteous, helpful and very accommodating.

The beach was so beautiful  and not too crowded.We want to thank the  entire staff from arriving(sea and land transportation), at the welcome center, the front desk, the restaurants, pool side, gym, securities, spa, and the housekeeping staff. We enjoyed our stay for a week and will come back again and stay longer.",5,December 2022
"Definitely one of the better resorts in Boracay, irregardless of what station you are staying. The arrival and departure scheme they provide is spot on. Similar to the Shang and Discovery. The wait lounge is a nice touch. Booking a villa with plunge pool can be expensive but it is the perks worth noting. Specifically the afternoon tea or villa cocktails as they call it , at the Mosaic. The villa in itself is loaded with luxurious amenities. The 3 huge flat screen smart Tv shouts extravagance , specially when the 3rd is located at your huge bathroom. Mini bar items are free on one time consumption. Nespresso coffee pods refill daily. Touch operated black out curtains and drapes.  Our daily breakfast was at Azure , and it was buffet , but if it was exclusivity it is not ,‚Ä¶",5,December 2022

When we arrived, we were met by Joy, the guest service officer assigned to us and led us to our villa. She made our check-in and check-out experience stress free.   The room was already set up with a couple of freebies (fruits, pastries, and a bottle of Merlot). The villa was clean and spacious, and our plunge pool was also cleaned everyday!   Food was excellent. There was not a meal that I did not enjoy. You know buffet breakfast is good when the pastries aren't dry. It was all soft and moist!

"Everything was great, staff were all wonderful but there were 2 people who made our stay really memorable: First was John, who assisted us with our check-in. He was super! He gave us all the information we needed for our stay and beyond. He made sure we knew about hotel activities, and even escorted us up to our rooms to make sure everything was in order. He gave us a glimpse of the care and hospitality we were about to experience over the next 3 days. Next was Ray, who always had a welcoming smile as we had our breakfast at Saffron everyday. He always checked in on us to see if we needed anything. You should try his tea concoction, it was delicious! We will definitely be back, we already booked tickets for June :)",5,December 2022
Aside from the fact that the resort is co cozy beautiful but what made our stay more memorable and one that will cherish it for lifetime is the hospitality of ur staffs and i most want to commend Mr. Vincci of concierge for a job very well done.

Indeed it was a beautiful experience for us honeymooners and my family. There were a lot of events during our stay over the weekend. Foods were top notch especially their breakfast buffet which we all look forward to every day. The beach front view of our room was breathtaking and you can just spend your time looking over the horizon and soak in the beauty of the beach and the place. But what sets them apart from other beach resorts is the high quality service that all their staff provides (including how good they take photos for you and your friends and loved ones <3). We'll be back for more that's for sure.  PS  Special thanks to one of their managers Nico Jhie Alejandrino for her outstanding accommodation!,5,December 2022

"We spontaneously decided to take a break from the stress, traffic and holiday invitations. That turned out to be a great decision. From our first encounter with Crimson's staff at the airport, to the final warm smile and goodbye, this holiday was stress free. The perfect and seamless transfers, the refreshment at the beautiful welcome center, the conch-blowing, drum beating welcome as we arrived on the beach fronting the resort, every detail was meticulously planned. Our suite was spacious, very clean and beautifully decorated. The ocean view from the balcony was gorgeous.

Their customer service is incredible and their employees go above and beyond. They have given us an experience to remember.  We were blown away with how incredible they have been to us. Especially Bee-Jay from the beach/pool, he had our towels and glasses of water ready for us every day before we arrived at the beach. He would always take note when our drinks were empty and come back with a refill shortly after. He went so above and beyond with the all little things he did for us and we are so appreciative.

"First time in Boracay. Transfers from and to the airport was top notch. We booked 3 rooms, 2 double suites with sea view and a king with pool access. Please take note or maybe take a video or what you‚Äôre booking. The email vaguely states ‚Äúsuites‚Äù on all our bookings. It doesn‚Äôt state what kind of bed or view we had paid for.    Upon checking in we were only offered a king suite with sofa bed.  We pushed for what we booked since we paid extra for having a double bed and a sea view. It was back and forth with the front desk. He kept on asking me for proof that I booked a double with sea view. It was very frustrating!  This is Crimsons responsibility not mine!

"Was with this splendid property from 6dec-9dec. From arrival to our transfer to another property in the Island, we felt the warmth and care by everyone. The property was just immaculately developed and beautifully maintained.    Crimson has its own cove, far from the madness that could be on the main strip. But, shuttle service was available in case you want to join in the fray at station 2 (3 or 1). Had to remind ourselves we are in Station 0. :)   Their secret we believe was the people across all service level and how they made our stay unforgettable. From the reception, grounds keeper to the staff of 3 restaurants we patronised,  they were exceptional - thoughtful, proactive, warm.  The smile and greetings are authentic ( not forced or scripted ).   We had an initial issue‚Ä¶",5,December 2022

We were upgraded to suite room and we got a congratulatory cake when we entered our room. The suite room was spacious and we had a great view of the garden and the beach. We always looked forward to having our breakfast, one of the best we've had! The bed, pillows and linens were the the most comfy ever! I recommend this hotel to couples and families when in Boracay. Customer service is superb, too. Truly a memorable experience for me and my hubby.",5,November 2022
"From booking, to transfers until check out, Crimson Boracay displayed utmost hospitality, exceptional customer care, truly honest housekeeping and an impeccably organized workforce. Ms Charlotte Aguilar of Sales handled the pre-stay arrangements and carefully attended to my booking requests, despite the high volume of delegates she had to cater to. Relaxation and leisure can be enjoyed without the bother of being repeatedly invited to take on certain trips, and other activities. Definitely no lurkers strolling by the shore.  Very safe for young kids to play along the sand since Crimson Boracay gives an exclusive vibe to the great enjoyment of its guests. I can't wait to bring my family on the next trip since I have 3 small kids!",5,November 2022

The hotel was very clean, the rooms were made up daily, the grounds were kept tidy, and the beach was also constantly kept free from debris. The buffet breakfast at Saffron was fantastic with its numerous selections of food to fit everyone's dietary preference. It has set the bar for me for out-of-town buffet breakfasts. We also found the food at Azure very tasty. But what really sets Crimson apart from other hotels are its people -- warm, courteous, very attentive, highly responsive, very helpful, yet discreet.

We got 3 in total and none of them my kids like even the dark chocolate has raisins and jam-like sauce (if I remember correctly). We chose Crimson as most reviews said they got the most prominent room among Boracay hotels but it's a little too small for us, family, or maybe it's just the furniture. Initially, our room was Hillview for 3 days and Seaview overnight but lucky for us! They gave us the sea view for 4 days straight! I'm not sure if it is because of our son's birthday.

So, the Duty Manager and his team went to our room to assist my dad And Mr. Jerome, immediately take an action to offer to bring my father to the nearest hospital. A big salute to them for being Attentive also to Mr. Jerome he is really a great asset to your company. We will come back for sure!",5,September 2022
"Crimson Resort went above and beyond expectations. From the moment we landed, we were treated with white-glove service. Staff is friendly and always helpful, especially our concierge, Soo-min Park. He made sure we had what we needed, when we needed it, and without asking. Ask for him if you go.",5,September 2022
"Crimson provided an exclusive feel yet not boring vibe of accommodation. Amenities are good. They put effort on sanitation, food is okay (dined in all 3 restos) and the complimentary transport service to and from the airport is a big plus most especially for families with small kids.  Only downside is that checkout is at 11am.",4,September 2022
"We really enjoyed our stay. Aside from the facility, we believe that your staff is one of your greatest assets. They made us feel a priority regardless of the number of guests that they need to attend because of the ACC event. We will definitely refer your hotel to our family and friends and will surely stay at your hotel on our next Boracay trip.",5,September 2022
"Weve been to Boracay several times and to several hotels as well. We visited the beach again to celebrate our wedding anniversary as a family and we want it to be special. So we decided to try the Crimson Resort in Boracay located at ""Station Zero"".  So heres my take... Staff - Very well trained and accomodating. This maybe the front desk staff or the life guards and security, they are all excellent. Food and Resto - the have a good spread and the design of the resto is also updated and very pleasing to the eyes. Food are fresh and tasty and we dont have any complaints about it.  Beach and Pool - they have some pool variety, for toddlers and for adults. They also have a 2 pools where you can see a good view of the beach. The pool near the beach were my kids favorite because‚Ä¶",5,August 2022

"It was my first time to Boracay and boy did it deliver! Definitely a paradise! We stayed there for our honeymoon and they gave us a welcome cake and the best villa ever with majestic views of the beach!   We were lucky enough to be able to use the docking at the beach front for the arrival, in doing so were able to see the whole western side of the island. Everything was so seamless from the transfers to check out and everything in between. The breakfast buffet of saffron probably one of the best in country, they had varied cuisines i mean evey major cuisine was represented.

"Great luxury hotel nestled in a quiet area of Boracay. It's more for people who do not wish to leave the resort as the streets outside the resort area look a bit rough. However, with so much to do inside the resort itself you probably wouldn't need to leave anyways. Great food at Azure Beach cafe.  Our waiter Willy and the chef there were fantastic. Fast service amazing quality meals. Avoid Mosaic restaurant it'd very overpriced and the quality of the food isn't as good and certainly does not match the price tag it's given. Overall, great facilities, food and service. They even had a painting class at the hotel.  Downsides - we booked a special package which included 10% off at all restaurants and 1 free dinner or lunch however not all staff knew about it and we had to remind‚Ä¶",4,September 2022

Almost everyone is warm and is ready to help at any time. We just had a not so good encounter with one of the front-desk personnel who seemed snub and annoyed when we asked about our late check-out request I had to mention this because it kind of ruined the night of my birthday and this made me feel uncomfortable during check-out.

Our bag got offloaded by Cebupacific, but the Hotel staff Sherwin took charge for us and an hour later while we were having breakfast, we were informed that our bag was already at the hotel. <3 Thank you so much Sherwin. We felt like all the staff are sincere when they greet the guests. They were very welcoming, approachable, warm and helpful. They even put their right hand to their chest, near the heart to show how sincere they are. The room was superb. It was cozy and warm. We felt well rested as sheets are always new and smelled good.

From the pickup at the airport terminal, the staff were super nice & friendly! The lounge at the boat transfer looks nice and clean. We were welcomed by the friendly staff, gave us hot towels, and drinks are free üòä Since the weather was not good, the boats can‚Äôt land on their property as should have been (which was fine), instead the drop off was at the keyhole!

Squeaky clean and I fought the urge to lay down or else I might sleep the entire stay. It's that comfortable.   The facilities are very extra -- from the infinity pool to the beach side one. All the things your eyes will land on can take your stress away.  The staff are so polite and greet us ALL THE TIME which made us feel very special and welcomed.

Service was impeccable. Given we only stayed two nights, we requested for them to transfer our things to our villa for the second night without us there. It was hassle -free for us.   My boyfriend also got lbm before we left and a nurse was available for consult and meds, when we initially just asked for meds. All our requests like additional toiletries were given to us with extras.

"Was very impressed with the Crimson property. Crimson Boracay has the best resort layout in Station Zero. Having the beach and pool very accessible is a major major feature. The resort itself is maintained well. Saw staff brushing seaweeds on the shore, pools are always clean even those inside the villa. Every staff we met was very friendly, Francine, John (Azure). Crimson made our stay very special as we felt cared for.  Food was fantastic, I appreciated that breakfast ""buffet"" is cooked upon ordering instead of letting the food get cold as per usual buffets. Thank you Crimson for a wonderful stay. Will be back with our kids next time!",5,July 2022

Seeing Crimson Boracay‚Äôs instagram profile, I immediately fell in love with the place and decided to book for a trip there.   I stayed at the resort from July 4-12, 2022 and I must say it was all worth it! The place is really as stunning as the photos from the internet. It has free transfer from airport to the hotel and vice versa which is very very hassle-free. It has a beach front which is pretty private for the hotel‚Äôs guests.

"Boracay is my favorite getaway place, even before it became so commercialized and crowded. I love Palawan, Siargao, and Cebu, but Boracay always beckons. I have been to every nook and cranny place on the island, from the cheapest to the priciest. Nowadays, I love to splurge and pamper myself. With so many choices to choose from, where can I go wrong? Crimson Boracay is one of those fancy places you might want to spend your money on, but because of its offerings, you might as well spend a good amount of money. This place is impressive, and it truly represents Filipino hospitality at its finest. From the moment I got to Caticlan and experienced a personalized service in their private jetty port (cold face towels!) to the ride to the island, it was a pleasant experience.

Really appreciate that they have their own welcome lounge (with free water, coffee and cookies) so we don't really need to line up in the crowded caticlan jetty port. We love our room, the breakfast buffet (special mention to Caloy, who was very attentive to our needs and would always greet us). We also tried eating in Mosaic and food was so good plus a very nice view especially at night. Great service also from the Azure beach club. Swimming pools are also very nice :)  Also, what I love the most here is that they have a lot of activities for the kids (sack race, treasure hunt, etc). Our son really had a great time here.

"There are a lot of pros and cons with our stay. On a good note, they seem to take social distancing and cleanliness very seriously, so it is appreciated that they sanitize guests hands before boarding the boat to the island. But they're not very consistent as no one was doing this when going back.  Good points 1. Some staff were awesome. Like Anton who checked us in and Eugene the lifeguard by Cobalt pool. He takes great photos.  2. Room was well designed. We had 2 rooms, 1 had the sea view which was great so opt for this choice if you can. Though it is a little more expensive.  3.

They were the ones who directed and decorated the proposal set-up. Everything was so creative, even I was surprised as well. The accommodation suite room with beach view is perfect.

We stayed for 1 night at this hotel but I wished we could have stayed longer. Crimson's amenities are topnotch and you really get what you paid for.   The foam party at the main pool was a blast! We stayed there last Saturday and coincidentally they were also celebrating pride month. It was so fun to see costumes being paraded by beautiful members of the LGBTQI community. The beach is pristine and the sunset divine. Special mention to Jelena from recreational activities as she is the most accommodating and friendliest staff we have ever met. She takes amazing photos and is very attentive to our needs. She is a gem.   Their breakfast buffet is one of the best ones we've ever had. Try their cheese rolls it is the absolute best. Getting to the airport felt like the ultimate VIP‚Ä¶,4,June 2022

"The whole stay was perfect.  Accommodations were comfortable, we booked a sea view.  Next time we will book a villa for the kids so they can have their own private pool. Even then we felt taken cared of from start to finish and after.  From boat transfers to facilities and staff.  It was easy to get to the other stations with E-tricycle which the front desk can arrange.  Food was delicious.  Breakfast buffet fills you up for a whole day of swimming at the beach or pool.  The Asian dinner buffet on our first night puts the diet on hold.   We also ordered room service a couple of times and had drinks at the Azure every night.  The lychee shakes with or without alcohol is the best.  Also, the foam party was something to look forward to.  But most importantly, we were on our way‚Ä¶",5,May 2022
Overall experience with Crimson is amazing. Just be aware that they do not have streaming services in their in-room entertainment. Beach area is perfect and offers exclusivity. They are actually nearby other station zero resorts but you wouldn't notice because they are situated between 2 rock formations.,5,June 2022
"The food and the views are absolutely superb as well as the staff and their service. We were so spoiled! Kudos to Banquet Manager, Sir Gelo. Sir Ray of Saffron and Miss Dianne of Azure.   Everything about this resort makes us want to come back again and again!",5,May 2022
"amazing views. clean waters. the food here in station zero outshines the ones we've tried in station two. my favorite experince was definitely interacting extremely kind and friendly staff of the restaurants Azure and Saffron, and most especially the bartenders at J's bar! we are definitely returning in the future",5,June 2022
"The place is beautiful, the food is amazing (so many variations to choose from), but most of all - we just can‚Äôt get enough of how well-trained and accommodating the staff (especially at Azure) are!   Special mention to Junil from Azure. He was very accommodating, pleasant and was so happy to serve us - my son had his 4th birthday celebrated there at the Azure. I would definitely go back and recommend Crimson Boracay to my friends and family!!!",5,June 2022

"From arrival to departure, it was perfect.  Highly recommended for those who wanted a quiet and relaxing Boracay stay.  Plus it's family-friendly, you can bring your kids without worry. No need to bring those sand castle toys as they have it there and kids can use it for free.   Food is superb and customer service is 5 stars. ‚ú®  Summary: ‚úÖ Lounge (while waiting for the boat, water, coffee, cookies and more are available there, a good break while waiting for the boat transfers) ‚úÖ Lounge crew (they are very helpful and friendly) ‚úÖ Check-in (smooth and quick) ‚úÖ Room (very clean, well thought as it has ceiling fan if aircon gets too cold you can use the ceiling fan, with unlimited Nespresso pods too) ‚úÖ Room service food (superb) ‚úÖ Restaurants (fresh and good food) ‚úÖ Swimming pools ‚úÖ‚Ä¶",5,June 2022

My youngest son was only one year old when we went to Crimson Boracay (Dec 2018)  I and two older kids aged 5 and 6 and our family‚Äôs stay there was pleasant. Food is kid friendly and their location seems to have the better sand and shore in Station Zero where other five star hotels are also situation. Food in Crimson Hotel is also better for us bec its more fairly priced. We also enjoyed a family photo session here during our stay. Highly recommended for families with small kids!,4,June 2021
"I stayed here with my family last May 14-16, 2022. We booked their Villa with plunge pool. The entire experience was memorable and the service was impeccable. From the airport and ferry transport all the way to the freebies/perks, the experience definitely screamed luxury.  It also has amenities that cater to children. I highly recommend this resort for  anyone who wants to experience the beach life away from the usual noise of the Boracay Stations. Plus, they have made it so convenient to go to the other stations with their free scheduled vans/busses so you don't miss out on anything.",4,May 2022
"I DO NOT LIKE THE BEACH -- but Crimson Boracay CHANGED MY MIND PRETTY QUICKLY. Being a ""Winter-Autumn"" type person, I am always tensed around a beach -- but the experience I had with one of the Villas of The Crimson Boracay took a shot and had my heart set to come back soon.  Firstly this place goes beyond the TROPICAL STYLE and is ACTUALLY TROPICALLY Adapted. As someone who teaches tropical architecture, the double glazed tinted windows in powder coated aluminum frames had me impressed from the moment I walked into the Villa and the Restaurant. It's not about the look of a tropical space but the ability to adapt in the temperate weather of the Philippines that counts.  The Mechanical Systems in the bathroom, which includes the tub, toilet and lavatory are of high quality which‚Ä¶",5,May 2022
"I originally planned my husband‚Äôs surprise birthday party along with 20+ friends and family all visiting from Paris at a private villa but after an on-site visit I had to quickly change venues as the original location was not the state it was in its online advert.  After going to Crimson and speaking with Jonil at Azure I knew I was at the right place.  With only a couple of days to plan, Jonil made the start of what would be an all day celebration perfect.  Jonil made everything so painless and was so efficient.  From the table dressing to the wine to the menu selection, to the service, all was exceptional.    My sincere thanks to Jonil and to chef Rajesh for everything.  We will definitely be back.  G Millar",5,April 2022
"Overall very good service but Rey Pinoglio who serves in the Saffron restaurant stands out with his ""excellent service with a smile"". Always ready and willing to go the extra mile. And the buffet  breakfast was excellent - especially the fresh baked croissants.  Facilities are first class but staff could be better trained on giving instructions to guests on how to connect to the internet, how to inform housekeeping to make up room while away, alternate routes to take especially when elevator temporarily not working, etc.",4,May 2022
"My family and I a regular Boracay visitors. Crimson is the latest resort we've stayed in and I only have good words.  A resort/hotel may have the best facilities, but it is the people (management and staff) who will make the place truly worth remembering, enjoying and coming back to. Special shoutout to all the staff! I can't recall all their names but I remember Onyok, Honey (front office) and most esp. Ray (saffron)! My gosh, ""kuya"" Ray spoiled my son. Hahaha. Very caring, asks what my son would like to eat and even if my son did not mention any specific food, he would come back with a plate of bread, pastries, etc. At the end of our stay, he gave kuya Ray a big thanks and hug in appreciation for all the care and attention the latter gave to him.

I like to commend Art from the J pool bar for being accomodating to all of our requests and we are truly entertained. The contact center is really fast in taking our call and attending to our needs. Front office team extent assistance from time to time. Unfortunately, after our dinner, the room was really hot and the AC is not working from 7PM to 10PM. I think the room is not ready for accommodation since the shower drain is so slow to drain. The drain in the tub is not working as well.",3,May 2022
The staff was amazing and very well trained. They always made sure our needs were attended to. A lot of them would go the extra mile to attend to our needs.   The property is beautiful!

"Crimson has the best team on the ground. From the warmest welcome to taking every requests and preferences you have seriously. Ms Shien the receptionist was super friendly and helpful. However, during my stay one of the feedback I have was the hair dryer is only available upon request, I was rushing to get ready for my dinner and we have called 3 times to rush for it. Obviously I was not very happy with it and we didn‚Äôt expect that they actually offer us a bottle of wine for service recovery. Kudos to the duty manager Mr Benjore for such nice gesture even towards small issue like this. Appreciated. Throughout the stay, the staff are super friendly, I repeat, everyone of the staff!

Crimson Boracay has a very positive vibe the moment you get off their private ferry because of the wonderful staff Ray of Saffron made every breakfast a wonderful experience  knowing all our requests will always be taken care of.

Eugene at the Cobalt Infinity pool contributed to the incomparable experience and Joemel at the beachfront had towels ready and wiped down the cabana for us.,5,May 2022

From breakfast buffet to dinner buffet is very good. The resort was peaceful and not crowded. We highly recommend this for a family vacation with a hassle-free and memorable experience. The staffs are so accommodating from the concierge to the reception are superb. Of course, Jerome, Duty Manager give us a tour of the resorts and they give a room upgrade discount with a nice view and lastly, he attended to our needs all the time. Salute to this Young Man!

The resort is located on its own private beach; so once you step out of your room and make your way to the beach you‚Äôll have a nice almost private experience. You‚Äôll of course share the beach with the other guests but because it is in station zero it is not open to the public. The rooms are extremely clean and kept that way everyday too.

There was a bit of a wait though as we were not that satisfied at first with the room they transferred us to but the Duty Manager, I think his name was Benjore and he made it up to us by upgrading us to a Villa and even gave us complimentary wine when I mentioned that it was my birthday.

"This trip was our first time visiting Boracay Islands. Boracay in itself is already famous among tourists both foreign and local so were already hyped with expectations even before landing on the white sand beaches of Boracay.  Upon landing at Caticlan Airport, we were greeted with warm smiles from Crimson Staff guiding us to our service vehicle. This will drive us to Crimson Welcome Center where a boat is waiting for us for our boat ride to Station 0, where Crimson resort and Spa is located. It took us around 35 minutes from the Airport to Crimson Resort (Drive plus boat ride).  Upon arrival in the resort, check-in went on smoothly, and our room was clean and spacious.

My children loved the pool and the complimentary snacks. I must say the hotel was very generous with the snacks and giving away bottled water upon request. The facilities were very clean.

Super clean, and great vibe location. Until next time!",5,April 2022
"Perfect hotel to enjoy quality and safety.  Boracay is really expensive which surprised us too much. The pizza price in a good restaurant is around 10-15USD which is almost same price in Europe.  Another problem is ,the approach of the local people. They always lie and see the tourists as money machine. So, they do all effort to get your all money.  Besides that, the men of the island are looks like dangerous. When a nice lady passing near them, they start to shout and say bad words.  For me it was full of disappointment.  But, the beach is great. I suggest you to book a hotel such as Crimson, ShangriLa to enjoy quality and safety. Staying in the middle class Hotel is not worthy to go Boracay.",5,April 2022

Our luggages were disinfected and delivered to our villa.   We reached Bora few hours earlier than our check-in time (3pm), so we decided to have breakfast first at Saffron.

"Service at the hotel was a massive hit or miss. When it‚Äôs good, it‚Äôs really good, but when it‚Äôs bad, it‚Äôs really really bad.   The room itself was good, the beach and pool were beautiful, the staff were all polite and friendly and there were many good moments. I really wanted to like the hotel, I really did‚Ä¶ but there were so many incidences where the service was just really not up to par.   We arrived on Monday noon, thought it was a good touch that they asked us if we wanted to preorder our lunch from the boat dock so that we‚Äôd be served as soon as we arrived at the resort. Around an hour later, we arrived and got seated at the restaurant‚Ä¶ where we waited for 1 hour before any of our food started coming out.

"Crimson Hotel is one of the Best Hotels in Boracay and a perfect place for a family vacation. It was peaceful and relaxing staying there. We booked our reservation last month service is great. Staff members are helpful, approachable, and very friendly, especially the Duty manager - Jerome who assisted us and gave Complimentary wine and shake for my daughter. I suggest putting Live-band on the Beach Front For Romantic dinner not only in mosaic. The food was good and we had a blast spending our family quality time.    Salute Crimson Boracay. We will come back soon.",5,April 2022
"We had an amazing stay and surely an unforgettable vacation.  The resort amenities and facilities are amazing. Food in the restaurant is amazing and staff is courteous, approachable.   Although there were a few hiccups, during our stay. There were housekeeping issues, bathroom issues and the careline being unaccessible that we had to personally complain at the front desk. But everything was sorted out because of the Duty Manager Benjore. Special shoutout to him because he went above and beyond in making sure that our needs were met. He went the extra mile to convert our frowns to smiles so that our vacation became a memorable one. If not for him, our stay there wouldn't have been a five star experience.   All in all, it is a vacation that we will surely to repeat in Crimson.‚Ä¶",5,April 2022

"My friend and I decided to book Crimson Hotel to cap off our 2-week Boracay vacation. Let me start with the positives:   1. They let us avail of the breakfast buffet(good selection with noodle bar!) on our first day because we will leave early on our last day. 2. Lots of activities - ideal for families with kids. Day beds are more than sufficient even during weekends. The foam party every Saturday is a fun experience (it's more family oriented rather than beach foam party/vibe)  3. As this is located in Station 0, the beach has more 'exclusive' feel to it. 4. Beds are comfortable   Now for the negatives:  1. There was a slight miscommunication with the concierge regarding the free shuttle service. I raised this to the 'virtual butler' via viber, and I was advised that the Duty‚Ä¶",2,March 2022

The check-in process was smooth. We had lunch while waiting for our Villa Suite Room to be available.  Our Villa was very serene and relaxing, most especially the comfortable bed.

"We loved everything about our stay in Crimson Boracay. From their service in the airport, to our room. We were checked in early which we didn't expect. The room was very spacious and clean. The food was delicious. The view was breathtaking. We swam like 2-3 hours in the morning and in the afternoon. Our son enjoyed so much and so did we. We specifically loved our afternoon ""tambay"" by the beach sitting on their beach chairs, staring at the horizon while eating our favorite salt and pepper squid and four cheese pizza blanca. The staff were super nice and always smiling and always asking us if we need something. They really took care of us. Will definitely come back. Thank you, Crimson for such a wonderful experience!",5,March 2022
"We celebrated our 10th year anniversary in Crimson Mactan and now our 14th anniversary in Crimson Boracay. Aside from we love Crimson overall, it is  something extra because of the great beach that the island offers. What else can you expect from it being a 5 star hotel but Crimson makes the service homey with a little something extra by going above and beyond - We just asked the manager about the restos and we got an unexpected dinner anniversary gift. We ask to warm our food inside the room and it came back with different condiments for us to enjoy. From the transfers to the departure, it is excellent! We will definitely go back to Crimson Boracay. Looking forward to spending more anniversaries with you!",5,March 2022
"Over the years I have stayed at many first class hotels around the world and can honestly say that the Crimson Resort & Spa is second to none of them. My wife and I honeymooned there for 5 nights during March'22 in one of their villas. The location, accommodation, 3 restaurants/food, 3 pools and other facilities were exemplary (we did not sample the spa or gym during our stay but expect they are of the same standard as the rest of the resort). We were greeted at the airport then taken by one of the resort's cars to their reception building on the mainland next to their private jetty. From there we were taken to the resort by one of their dedicated speed boats, being dropped off on the beach infront of the hotel before being ushered to reception and a smooth check in process.  ‚Ä¶",5,March 2022
"We stayed at Crimson on March 23 to 25.  This is my second time to book with them (first time was Dec 2020). I thought the service was ultimately satisfactory the first time we went there because they have a very few guests since it's still pandemic at that time and vaccine is not yet discovered.  But when I get back,  service got even better.     The hotel is still new with great facade, great food and great amenities and great staff.  Special thanks to Grace, Jonil, Joy, Honey,  Henz, Dior, all the staff in the Mosaic and Azure Restaurants, all the kuys and beautiful staff who always made sure all our needs are ok and we are comfortable.. you are all so great!!!  We are ultimately satisfied with your service.  Hope to see you all soon again.",5,March 2022
"My most recent trip to Boracay was halted so many times in the past months due to the pandemic and lockdowns. It took us 5 rebookings, and continuous coordination with Crimson Boracay's reservations team to work on the rescheduling.   That was why when my family's trip this month pushed through, the Crimson Team made sure that it was all worth the wait. And they made it perfect. Just perfect!  The food was one the best there is. PJ, helped me find a yacht I can rent for a sunset cruise. Roger, the head of the Concierge, always made sure that I get the best out of the reservations we made.

Third (concierge's name) goes way above and beyond in assisting me, even before I even arrived at the resort, sending me complimentary pick-up from another hotel, assisting me during check-in,  even calling me every now and then asking if there is anything else I need, feels like I booked the most expensive room.  The staff of Saffron Cafe (Ray, Jona, and Diana) are the friendliest bunch. Helped me decide on my lunch and remembered me until the next day during breakfast.  Grace (staff) of‚Ä¶",5,February 2022

Special mention to Gywneth and Harold who helped my now fiance pull off a surprise proposal , they gave us a romantic spot of the resort with a nice view of the sunset! So thankyouu it was very memorable for me , and i must say we get our money‚Äôs worth! Will surely comeback!",5,February 2022
"I was very happy staying in Crimson. It was an amazing experience to be riding a speedboat going to the resort. Then it was a surprise to see our room with  happy anniversary greetings for my mom and dad. We had a very nice room and enjoyed swimming in the plunge pool. Breakfast and food were very good. I loved the hot chocolate and bacon which I usually get for my breakfast. I appreciate that Kuya Rey and Ate Mitch in Saffron Cafe would check on us if we still need anything . The people were kind and friendly and we got great service from the staff. They are friendly to kids like me. They took care of us since the first day until we left.  The pools were nice and warm. It was an enjoyable experience. I also had fun playing with the sand, swimming and catching waves in the beach‚Ä¶",5,February 2022
"I was never been this excited going back to Crimson Boracay for this visit. And everything went excellent as expected. Our land and sea transfers were seamless and efficient. The welcoming officer and van driver welcomed us nicely. The boatmen are pleasant too. It's my first time to docked in the beach front of the resort. Upon arrival at the Lobby Jestin and Harold welcomed us nicely. Jestin is a familiar face who always assist me and bring me up to my room every stay. Efficient check in. Thank you Harold and Jestin.

"I'm a huge fan of great hotels and whenever I travel I make sure to visit some. I came to visit the restaurant of Crimson yesterday. Arrived around 5:30pm and was able to see the beautiful sunset.  Looking at the sunset while taking a sip of your naked rock cocktail made by Ver. It was really good!   Afterwards, I went to Mosaic for dinner and ordered their 5-course Valentines set. The staff is extremely polite and polished in fine dining service. I requested for few adjustments on the menu since I‚Äôm allergic to oysters and in a no beef diet. Chef Ynan made it so perfect with regards to the taste and presentation of all the courses. Wonderful!   Lastly, the view was jaw dropping and the ambiance was stunning!   Thank you.  ‚ù§Ô∏è-Maya",5,February 2022

"I've been to Boracay 5 times but this is the first time that I stayed in Crimson. I would say it is among the top resorts in the island equal to Discovery and Shang. My wife wanted us to book in Crimson because of the kid-friendly vibe and amenities it features. It definitely met our expectations even if the Pirate Ship and Kids Activity Rooms were not operational during our stay. The staff were very friendly and attentive to guests needs. The room, even the most basic one, is very spacious and kid-friendly. Overall, this will be our top choice whenever travelling with kids and will recommend to other parents visiting the island.",5,February 2022
"Very amazing view, safe environment, peaceful and very accommodating staff. They cater to everything we need, they have delicious food, comfortable and spacious rooms. They took care of us from the time we arrived at airport until our flight back. They are very flexible to rebooking.

"Booked for 3 days and 4 nights in crimson boracay with a sea view deluxe room. Our room was located at the 3rd floor and it was enough to capture the sunset and beach view from your window. The staff were helpful during our stay. A lot spoke in visayan which helped us from exploring more of the island. Most of the Resto to try are in stations 1-3, and the hotel is far away which requires you to take an e-trike. Tourist tip: take the individual rate whenever you ride the e-trike. It ranges from Php 20-30/person. Overall, will definitely go back to boracay and consider booking in crimson again!",5,February 2022
Awesome suite and breakfast. It felt safe and clean the entire stay. Staff were very attentive to our needs and to hygiene and were the real jewels of our trip.  Looking forward to those hearty quesadillas with drinks by the pool again.,5,February 2022
"We had a romantic, luxurious, worry & stress free vacation.   1. Front desk personnel specially Henz always made sure our resort stay was comfortable. We communicated via the Viber app which made any room request fast.   2. Only the Azure restaurant was open due to the pandemic but it served a wide variety of cuisine all-day.   3. Kudos to lifeguard Eugene for volunteering to be our sunset photographer. He had great photography skills!   Will definitely go back.",5,January 2022

The whole place was scenic, the food served were exquisite with various types of cuisines and most importantly the staffs are friendly and accommodating. In comparison to the other resorts or hotel that we‚Äôve checked in at Boracay, this is by far the best hotel that I would recommend to my friends that is worth the price.",5,January 2022
"Stayed there for 4D3N (Jan26-29,2022) and we felt that we were celebrities and VIPs during our stay. The hotel was very clean. The staff are very hospitable. Big shout to Gelo, Caloi, Dhanica, and Ver of Azure Restaurant for an outstanding service they gave us during our stay. We had a problem at room 1310 in our 2nd night. Due to heavy rain, our room had a water leak from the window. Per their engineering team, it was due to the tear of sealant. After checking, the front desk already called and advised us that a new room is ready for us. Great contingency plan for Crimson Boracay! The whole stay was very relaxing and stress free. We really had a great time! We will surely book again with Crimson Boracay. It was really worth it.",5,January 2022

"Our visit to Crimson was a gift from a friend for our Wedding. Initially we were already planning to book a stay at Crimson so we were really ecstatic when it was given to us as a gift. The Crimson team has been very helpful from the get go. They sent a detailed email instruction on the things to do before flying to Boracay. They also asked for our flight details as they arranged all transfers from Caticlan to Crimson Hotel. Upon landing to Caticlan, a staff was already waiting. Terminal fees and environmental fees were already paid for by the hotel, all we needed to do was to pay the hotel upon checkout all the fees that they paid for us (very convenient as we did not need to queue or even bring out our wallet for anything). From Caticlan, a car picked us up and it took us to‚Ä¶",5,January 2022

Check-in and check-out experience is smooth and hustle-free from the airport to the resort and vice versa.

"Excellent Accommodations. Awesome buildings. Warm staff. Worth to come back to!  That pretty much summarises our 4 day three night stay at the Crimson de Boracay. I stayed there in an 12 pax group. We have Children, Seniors, a pregnant woman and everyone else in between. From sun up, we're excited what food to get from the buffet and in the afternoon, we'll have cocktails at the mosaic bar. Even if all you want to do is stay at the beach and drink some juice, it's so worth it. Though, in my experience, all my trips to Boracay are fun, but staying at the Crimson is exceptional, cause I felt really taken cared of all the time. And I didn't even worry about leaving my stuff anywhere cause I know that no one will steal it and that I am perfectly safe.   Too bad there's a pandemic,‚Ä¶",5,December 2021

The staff are very courteous, warm and very accommodating, specially Sir Harold of the FO, Sir Ver and sorry but i forgot the female manager who helped set-up a romantic dinner for us on our last night, and all the Azure staff kudos to all of them. The rooms are very neat and well sanitized. The Beach front is very instagramable (if there‚Äôs such a word).

We went there to celebrate our 8th Wedding Anniversary and all of our requests were done exactly as what we imagined. They even upgraded our room from Suite Villa to a Regular Villa. The room was already well equipped and our additional requests for our kid were accommodated with excellent service.  The scenery was beautiful and it was a relieve to walk in such a quiet and peaceful environment. Cleanliness and sanitation is a priority for them and we felt safe within their premises. We highly recommend this hotel for anyone who would like to take a break from the busy city.",5,January 2022

We also enjoyed the privacy at Station Zero - Crimson Boracay.  The front desk officer, Mr. Harold, assisted us with the check-in process. While waiting for our preferred and upgraded room which was Suite with Sea View / Beachfront, they let us stay at the deluxe room with garden view for free. I would never have believed that Crimson Boracay would surpass our expectations.   I proposed to my girlfriend on NYE and Mr. Alvin Floau (staff) helped me find a bouquet for my special moment.

We were offered the suite with direct access to the pool and were welcomed with a very touching surprise of a cake, banner and AVP playing on the TV to celebrate our honeymoon. Just goes to show how much trouble the staff takes to make their guests feel as welcome and as at-home-away-from-home as possible.

The resort is fantastic with its modern architecture, swimming pools and well-appointed rooms (omg, you won‚Äôt want to get out of the comfy bed!).   It was a lovely night for these young newlyweds to start their life together, and an enjoyable one for their guests not least of all because of the excellent food and beautiful set-up under a transparent tent (it rained that night, which we didn‚Äôt even really notice).

"One of the best resort in Boracay that I have stayed. Very private as you share the beach with 2 other hotel guests only. Very clean rooms with amazing full ocean view on the suite. Rooms are top rate automated curtain. Can jog and do activities around the compound and play some board games. Gym is small but has most needed equipmentq. Beach is very good free use of Kayak but only 1 available. Restaurant has good selection unfortunately close on some resto because of the pandemic. But they keep you safe as they took extra steps to sanitize stuff given to you.  Booked a great deal sadly its pricey now.  Lots of pool to swim around. Only problem is if you are not on villa, you have a long walk to the beach. Wifi is strong.",5,March 2021

The rooms were thoughtfully designed; spacious, generous, and elegant.  In my honest opinion and with the limitations of my experiences and memory, the quality and comfort of their bed, mattress topper, and duvet combination is second only to the legendary beds of the Sofitel Metropole in Hanoi and a clear notch above the Westin Heavenly Bed and the beds at The Jaya House in Siem Reap while the sheets are slightly comparable to any Four Seasons in the world. This could possibly be one of the best night's sleep in the Philippines were it not for the pillows. Pillows could be better, but I could be wrong.  The resort‚Ä¶",5,December 2021
"I went with my family on a Christmas Holiday last week, Since the hotel is situated on Boracay Island away from the airport, Transport with family was excellently handled by Mr. Third and Mr. Vincci Dennie Dalid, despite being stranded there due to on-going typhoon, Hat's Off to you both very friendly and very helpful, On spot service, Transport and flight tickets were re-booked by them immediately.  Food and In-Room dinning maybe a bit expensive but the service from all the staff including restaurant especially Mr. Ronald from Azure Bar provided us with 5-Star service,    After coming back to manila me and my family miss the friendly , polite and professional staff already, Felt like we were treated special and that they were part of the family.",5,December 2021
"I am so glad that I chose Crimson Hotel during our Boracay family vacation. The place was always neat and clean. I felt very safe despit the threat of Covid. The food was sumptuous and wonderful. So many choices in the buffet, but the croissants, in various flavors, were my personal favorites.  Lastly, the staff are commedable. Very friendly and immediately caters to all my family's needs. Special shoutout to Ms.Dior, Sir Vincci and Sir Thirdy for helping us out with our travel hiatus due to typhoon #Odette. We now have arrived home safely, which would have been almost impossible without your help. Merry Christmas. This trip is definitely one for the books.",5,December 2021
"This vacation was a great one for the family. During a time when  sanitation is key,  they ensured cleanliness strict protocols yet very smooth and easy. The rooms and dining were just perfect. The personnel and hospitality just simply the best.    Our family will remember this forever ‚ù£Ô∏è",5,December 2021
"We booked Deluxe Hillview and the room was nice almost complete with the amenties.  All our travel is very smooth, they asked for our flight details and emailed us the requirements going to the Island(this is last July 2021) and assisted us to get the QR codes. :) The hotel booking is already inclusive of land and sea transportation(only exclusive to the Crimson guests) from Caticlan airport to the Hotel so super hassle free. But what I was super impressive about is when the time the gov't announced for a ECQ lockdown down then our flight got cancelled. Thirdy(one of the CSR) was able to help us to rebooked our cancelled flight to Manila within 1hr. We just gave him our flight details.",5,July 2021
It was a very memorable stay for our family.  It was my son's 9th birthday when we arrived and they made it more special when they surprised us with a room upgrade! This was also the first family trip we had after 2 years.  We stayed for 4 days and 3 nights at the resort and we had an awesome time all throughout our stay.  All the staff were very attentive to our needs and very friendly. A special shout out to Miss Maffy!   We have everything we need at the resort.  We were taken care of from the airport to the resort and vice versa.  We would definitely be back!,5,December 2021
"Excellent customer service!!! We stayed in their customer lounge while waiting for the boat. when we arrived at the hotel, We were welcomed by Dior, we arrived earlier than the check-in time, she managed to give us 1 out of 3rooms we booked for our kids to stay.  The food was great! Lots of choices with their cocktails. All of the staff were accomodating and very friendly. Ray of Saffron Cafe is very caring, had a great time even having our breakfast. Melchor of housekeeping was in PPE while cleaning our room, Rush, staff in the airport, and everyone had given us excellent service. Even marc and rjay from the reservations team were very patient and accomodating. Especially with Dior, got a problem with my parcel, she manage to let me enjoy my stay and deal with the courier.

"Can I just say that your resort was perfect. From the moment we arrived in Caticlan, we just knew this will be a worthwhile experience. Your team have achieved the highest level of customer service promoting excellent customer experience. The perfect getaway for my family especially with a 10-month old baby. You made it easy, quick, smooth and relaxing plus the unlimited surprises and treats. You treat all of your guests like VIPs. Truly amazing. Special mention to Maffy, Caloy, Rey and the two 2 folks who drove us to and from Caticlan. Actually all of your staffs were polite and friendly. Making the ambience feel homey. A highly recommended resort! I wish people can experience this amazing resort. Thank you, Crimson. Will definitely be back. ‚ô•Ô∏è",5,December 2021
"I was astounded by how clean the hotel rooms and surroundings were. The artwork, as well as the exteriors and interiors, are excellent! I like how accommodating and kind the staff is, especially Rey at Saffron Cafe. Our three-day stay in Crimson was well worth it, not just because of the lovely scenery, but also because of the wonderful service and food, and it truly felt like home to me.",5,December 2021
"What can I say about our 1st time at Boracay? Redemption! Our stay got cut short due to the typhoon, but all the staffs made our short stay a very memorable one, they even rebook our flights on our behalf while we pack our stuffs for an hour..how awesome is that?!

"My mom won this Gift Certifcate in Rustans for a 3 days 2 nights stay for 4 adults at a Villa in Crimson Boracay. Luckily, we were able to book the Villa on my birthday! We would like to thank Rustans and Crimson Boracay for happily accommodating my family even though the GC was already about 2 yrs old (won before the pandemic). We are extremely happy with the Crimson experience, the courteous and friendly staff, the breakfast buffet and the complimentary afternoon cocktails... Food was always superb. Thank you chef!

"This recent trip to Boracay was one of the most relaxing I've had. Me and my fam are happy to have stayed in Crimson, and we are looking forward to staying here again next time. We enjoyed the Villa, most definitely its private pool and complimentary afternoon cocktails with an amazing view of the beach and the sunset. The massage was amazing as well. The breakfast buffet was enjoyable too. My faves were the fluffy pancakes, their homemade Italian sausage and the beef mechado. Super thank you also to Dior who made our stay more beautiful and stress-free. She made sure all our needs are met daily. All in all, we highly recommend this hotel. With its ambiance, food, friendly staff, good location...Crimson is the ultimate place to stay in Boracay for a much-needed break.",5,December 2021

There were few hiccups but kudos to Shein from FO  for resolving it efficiently. Excellent service all throughout . Special mention to Bee Jay of Azure team for the service. Make sure to look for him when you‚Äôre there. Perfect for families and/or couples who would like to stay away from the crowd of Station 1 to 3. Got to enjoy the private beach cove.  Will definitely be back!,5,December 2021
Where do I begin? Booking to stay at Crimson is like trying to book the White House and Washington DC. It‚Äôs so difficult and when you speak to the Reservations its like you have to squeeze the information out of them. You cannot confirm a bed type. Seriously?? dont you have a system in front of you? Do you physically setup the bed depending on what you want? We requested for a Kimg but got a Twin instead. The reservations manager needs someone to soap his mouth so clean words come out of his mouth. Very rude. Maybe because we booked the cheapest rooms? Wonder if they switch beds from room to room. Really unexpceted. We had the absolute pleasure of meeting Zeon who sorted things for us after nearly 2 hours. We had to wait for our king bed but honestly worth the wait. He gave us a‚Ä¶,5,November 2021
"It was nice to be back in Crimson Boracay after 2 yrs. We really wanted a place where we can relax and unwind and still feel safe in this time of pandemic. Crimson has taken all the preventive measures necessary in order to make us feel safe and comfortable.   The daily breakfast buffet at Saffron was sumptuous as expected! Pastries by Chef Philip were to die for that we had to bring back home to Manila boxes of croissants and calamnsi muffins.  Food at Azure were delicious. Thanks to Chef Pi and Chef Blan of Azure for accommodating my request of sinigang na salmon belly. So happy that they satisfied my random craving for a very sour soup.   What's not to love about their private beach front?  Lounging by the beach, drinking cocktails while watching the sunset minus the crowd.‚Ä¶",5,December 2021
"We are on our second week of our month-long stay here at Crimson Resort and Spa Boracay and we really wish we could slow down time because we are enjoying every minute here. Here are the things we enjoy most:   1. Private Beach - In the morning you can have the beach to yourself! Punta Bunga is a very charming beach that is almost 2 kilometers in length and is shared by Crimson, Movenpick and Shangri-la resorts. We went to stations 1, 2, and 3 couple of days back and were so suprised of the influx of tourists. Its like the old normal already.  2. Wifi - I am a Doctor of Medicine and as a Radiologist I interpret CT scan, MRI, and X-ray so a good internet connection is necessary.

"Traveling during the pandemic is quitr challenging but I felt very safe in the resort as it‚Äôs not crowded and they abide by good health protocols. The staff were incredibly corteous and accommodating, the food was great, the rooms were the best and the beach and its privacy was a dream come true for an ultra paranoid person like me.   Must stay here!",5,December 2021
"It was our second time to stay and our stay this time has met our expectations and more. Thank you to Ms. Maffy for making our stay so wonderful! The food was nothing short of exquisite! Make sure to grab some croissants, hazelnut praline danish, and almond croissants during breakfast by Chef Philip! The calamansi muffins are so much better than what Real has - so fluffy and not nakakaumay. Over at Azure, we loved the food put out by Chefs Pi and Blan and the drinks over at the bar (Thank you, Arth!) was just perfect for your sunset gazing!  The one property in Boracay that we love going back to!",5,December 2021

We spent our 10th yr wedding anniversary here and our first post pandemic getaway with my husband! Everything was worth it and more than we ever expected. From very accommodating staff (they find means to pull off our romantic dinner by the beach) to modern and complete facilities both for adults and children. You don‚Äôt have to go to other stations as they have all the facilities that you and your children will enjoy and feel secure and safe with all their services. They also have 3 restaurants to choose from serving sumptuous meals! The buffet breakfast is really enjoyable will all the choices. Will definitely go back with the kids next time so they will also experience the joyful stay we had. Thanks again Crimson!‚ò∫Ô∏è,5,December 2021
"It was my first time staying at Crimson and after my experience, I‚Äôll always have this resort as my top choice when visiting Boracay again.  I enjoyed its private beach (which has powdery sand once you reach the knee-high depth) where you can enjoy happy hour, as well as the amazing sunset view, while relaxing on a lounge chair. We actually walked the stretch and reached other resorts and in my opinion, Crimson has the best beach.  We stayed in a villa with a plunge pool which could fit up to 4 people. The pool area was cute with lounge chairs and we also stayed there to eat dinner/have a few drinks. We only wish they had more trash bins inside the room. :)  Food at the Azure was good. However, breakfast at Saffron could be improved a little. The selection was pretty much the‚Ä¶",4,December 2021

From Roger at the Port, making sure that all are luggages will be cared for, biscuit and water during the kand transfer to the hotel, to John at the reception, giving us an luscious upgrade, to all their F&B staff at Azure. This trip, made it worth while. Azure also helped us set-up a small dinner celebration. Food were all good and tasty.

For our first week, here are the things we liked most and liked least:   Airport/Ferry/Shuttle Transfer - 5/5  The transfer team was very hospitable. They were well coordinated.

"I decided to spend my month-long birthday vacay @ Crimson. I booked a signature beachfront villa as a treat for my hard work as a business owner/blogger.  Originally it was booked for my birthday, but I had to reschedule because of a sudden change with hubby's schedule.  My excitement turned into a little disappointment.  It's definitely NOT worth the money that I spent.  I should have chosen the cheapest room instead .  Here's my ratings:  1.  The resort itself- 5 stars (I love everything, esp. the villa, the pools, and the private beach). 2.  Pre-arrival staff-  5 stars (I appreciate ICA for the assistance even beyond her        regular tour of duty. 3.

Everything went smoothly from the time we checked in until we were whisked off at the beachfront to the airport. Their rooms are very modern and immaculately clean. We also had a chance for some fine dining at their Mosaic outlet. If you need a relaxing massage, be sure to book your slot at the Aum Spa early as they can get booked very quickly.  Have fun at the beach!",5,November 2021
"We love the resort overall. The room was clean  spotless. We would like to commend John of Front Desk who was midnight duty at that time. He was very accommodating and gives feedback fast. Just had one unpleasant experience with a girl from the front desk (crimson care?) lunch time of November 28. Heard her sighing and she sounded exhausted. You should sound pleasant even when tired. Guess she didn‚Äôt have proper customer service training that she had to make a guest feel that calling her was a nuisance. Maybe the hotel should work on putting dedicated lines for housekeeping and in-room dining, instead? Calling ‚ÄúO‚Äù for EVERYTHING is such a hassle.",4,November 2021
"If you are in Boracay, you just can't go wrong with Crimson Boracay. From Arrival to Departure everything went a breeze and everyone was very accommodating to our needs. No hassle whatsoever. Special Mention to the FOM, Mr. Zeon Luis for making our stay more memorable. He did an extraordinary job for the birthday surprise of my son. Kudos to him and his team of staffs. Very professional and passionate to his work. A very dedicated manager. Thank you very much. Coolest manager ever.  Now on to the Design and layout of the Hotel is both remarkable yet unique since it caters to a more modern look than a traditional old school style seen on other hotels on the island.

"One thing I wish the hotel can improve further is their airport transfers. While we were promptly fetched at the airport, we waited for almost an hour at Caticlan seaport with no explanation. And since we took the speedboat and tour van c/o Southwest tours instead of the hotel‚Äôs private speedboat, it took us another hour for the sea and land travel.  Anyway, despite this small hiccup, we still enjoyed our stay at this beautiful resort. The suite room with seaview is truly the best! The buffet breakfast is also something to look forward to.

Vivid colors of the underwater paintings perks up your happy mood. The breakfast buffet makes me forget about my diet. Try their iced cappuccino it is the best.

I think its not that kid friendly for families who stays at deluxe or premier rooms coz i believe deluxe and premier is located in indigo building which has no elevatore and very far from the beach and the pool and restaurants. Dont recommend the deluxe or premier rooms for families with kids coz it will be very tiring for them and not that safe coz of lots of stairs to go up and down to.

It's easy for establishments to have nice amenities, but to have trained your staff and have dedication to their job is something else. From their coordinators in the airport, drivers, concierge, lifeguards, guards, waiters all have commendable attention to their guest. John, from the concierge was accomodating with our inquiries of upgrading our room even if we decided not to upgrade. The night shift staff were all helpful of our kid's needs. Management must be treating their staff well to have that kind of dedication. Shoutout to Vinci, the service coordinator and the guards for always being alert.   Food prices were surprising at first,‚Ä¶",5,November 2021

"Nov 2021 A few days after the incident last Sept, Crimson‚Äôs GM reached out to me to apologize and offered free nights on our next visit to Boracay.   We went last week and I think they made up for what happened. The room they provided us was nice  with a great view of the sea. We also felt safe  during our entire stay as they made extra effort to sanitize everything. Most of the staff were very accommodating to our needs as well. The people in their restaurants are also very attentive and friendly.  Their pizza and fruit shakes are a must try. They also have a lot of activities for kids and for even adults.   Overall, the experience was great!  Sept 2021  We were supposed to stay in Crimson on our last night in Bora since we read good reviews about the resort so we wanted to see‚Ä¶",4,November 2021
"The BEST in customer experience so far! From the time we planned our trip with the so many arrangements (we were a group of 20) up until we left, the staff took care of all our needs and beyond. Their commendable staff; Ria San Juan of Sales, Marc and ArJay of Reservations, Elvie of AUM Spa, Ica Santos their concierge and many more. we cannot be more delighted by the service extended by these staff to our family.   Special mention to Ica who went out of her way to help my sister who was booked at a different resort with her tourist code. My sister decided to join us at the last minute and Crimson could no longer accommodate her booking at that time since the resort was only allowed 50% capacity when we went.

"This is my first time to write a review. I‚Äôm doing it because I want to commend the staff who made our stay wonderful.  Special mention to Nico the duty manager, who is one of the reasons why I will call our experience in Crimson the best family vacation we ever had. She was really accommodating and very friendly. She went to us at Saffron instead of asking us to go to the front desk for our room keys. She made sure that our bunso got a surprise cake. We made some requests and she delivered and she exceeded our expectations.  Hats off to Gelo of Saffron. We were really tired and hungry when we arrived, so instead of waiting at the front desk for our room, we went straight to Saffron.

"Our expectations were high because 1 - Crimson is not a cheap hotel, 2 - You are Crimson, 3 - so many advertisements saying how good their stay was. I'm not sure if it's because we're local travelers but if our non-Pinoy guests experience what we experienced, I'm sure they also will be totally disappointed.   When we arrived, our room was not yet ready despite the disclaimer from your concierge that you allow 24-hrs for the room to be vacant for sanitation purposes. One of our rooms' shower had a leak and it reached the main room and was told to just ask Housekeeping to mop the floody mess every time (emphasis on the every time) someone uses the shower - what a complete hassle!

"My wife and I spent our honeymoon in Boracay and this was one of the hotels lined up for consideration. Making the choice to stay here was a good decision for us a couple because we were (and still are) blown away by the experience that Crimson had to offer.  First off, the rooms - with ours strategically positioned across the pool and relatively high enough for us to capture the Boracay sunset, the seaview is what you should gun for when making a booking with them. Prepare a tripod to attach to your camera because capturing a timelapse of the Boracay sunset from your room while sipping on a beer is one of the best things you could do here. The rooms are clean, too; there's ample heating in the water and the room isn't that cold.  Second, the beach - with Crimson being branded‚Ä¶",5,October 2021
"Our trip to Crimson Boracay has been nothing but spectacular. We have previously stayed in a neighboring resort also in Station 0 during our prepandemic Boracay trip but my kids really enjoyed Crimson Boracay more for its more upbeat vibe. The staff are always on top of things and really put an extra effort in making the Crimson experience of the guests nothing short of perfect. This sets the bar for personalized care in any hotel accommodation for me. Shout out to PJ, their guest relations manager, who made our stay in Boracay from great to spectacular.

"Rooms and overall hotel - clean, well spaced out, and socially distanced. Loved the spacious atmosphere, and even if Saffron was closed (they opened two days after we left!)  it was still a pleasant stay.   What set everything apart was the service - throughout our stay, despite being short staffed because of the pandemic, they were very attentive, and you did not have to wait long for room service or anything you needed from the room - be it wine, more towels, coffee, a buggy, etc.   If I could give this 1000 stars I would - I left my phone, a very important work phone in the room and I realized it at the airport.

From their transportation staff at the airport to the resort down to the service at the resort itself and Azure Beach Club. They were all super accommodating and hospitable. The staff here would randomly say 'hi' to you as if you feel really welcome which brings a smile to our face.

I think there were 2 rooms that we occupied when we were there but we seldom saw the guests. We really enjoyed our stay.

The free breakfast has a very wide variety, you could probably find what you're looking for when there. They offer things from traditional Filipino breakfast's, traditional American breakfast's, cereals, etc.  We enjoyed our stay so much that we extended our 3 day reservation to an entire week.

"My husband and I decided to book a 5 day trip to Boracay for our 2nd wedding anniversary. For the first two nights, we decided to stay at Crimson. This is our first time staying at a hotel over at station zero. From the airport we were picked up by the hotel‚Äôs private car (we took advantage of their voucher) Then we were lead to their private speedboat. We were the only ones on board, which made the experience more posh and luxurious. We didn‚Äôt get to dock on their beach front but this was apparently due to unfavorable waves, so we docked over at the Keyhole area instead and we were greeted with another private van. When we arrived at the hotel we were greeted with friendly faces and we felt so welcomed.   We totally fell in love with the place. The modern design of the hotel‚Ä¶",5,June 2021

They allowed us to check-out late, thank you! We were sent free food when we could not order on our 1st night. What a thoughtful gesture.  Thanks! Breakfast buffet was amazing w/ a lot of food choices. Was supposed to have free rt airport transfers but we extended our stay in Boracay and asked that we be brought to station 1 instead of the airport and was surprised that it‚Äôs not for free anymore. That‚Äôs the only letdown. The 2k dining credits was not applied as well the 15% off when you dine in as advertised. I would definitely go back and recommend Crimson Boracay to my friends.

"NOTE: This review comes from a person who has travelled to tourist destinations in the new normal starting Nov 2020: Boracay, Coron, Lapu-Lapu City and Panglao  Crimson is definitely a resort you would want to relax, enjoy the beach and the sand.  The resort is at Brgy Yapak and shares the area with Movenpick and Edsa Shangri-la.  I chose this over Movenpick because of the celebrities that checked-in prior to our stay.  The sand is not as fine as white beach--imagine Puka beach.  There are umbrellas and seats in the beach.  All the angles are picturesque and my partner and I enjoyed taking pictures in the beach.

"We had a great time staying at the place. The food is great, esp in our packed breakfast where we got bacon and sunnyside up (instead of hardboiled) albeit we didn't have chocolate croissants (lol). Bed was very comfortable, it's just that for our place, the ants seemingly are attracted to whatever we ate before sleeping (not in bed). Beach was perfect. Only matter was the snakes at night time which we didn't foresee. Will probably go back again.",4,June 2021
"Initially we werent that satisfied with our stay. There are limited facilities in the resort. There are no kids activities except only the pool. With the food, good thing they opened another resto for buffet breakfast on our 4rth day, otherwise we will be tired of eating the same over & over again. Weve tried all in their menu that on the 2nd day we wouldnt know what to eat anymore. Worst, on our 1st day after eating dinner, that night my husband got stomachache. So he was up all night and stayed in bed the whole day on the 2nd. On our 3rd day, its my youngest who got allergies and was rushed to a nearby clinic.

I stayed at Crimson for the first time for 4D3N in a Deluxe room during December 2020. I immediately came back to celebrate my birthday for another 4D3N in February 2021, this time staying in one of the two Signature Beachfront Villas. Both times, I went in a group of 4-5 friends.  The hotel itself is beautiful. Nestled at the end of Boracay's exclusive Station Zero, it has a pristine private beach. The rooms are all well appointed, and many of them (from Suites to Villas) come with their own private plunge pool. The design is just beautiful, and the rooms are all well-appointed.

Everything inside the room including their freebies are sealed and sanitized which made us feel safe. The private beach area is really breathtaking which is perfect for Sunset viewing. Life guards and staffs made us feel secured while in the beach area and are very attentive to everyone‚Äôs needs. Foods from Azure and Mosaic are Superb.

I start my day with the sumptuous breakfast spread at Saffron Cafe followed by early drinks, at Azure Beach Club, plus they offer a wide array of Asian food selection but my fave is the Inidan Tandoori , Curries and the Baked Oyster, i can finish a dozen  all to myself. Fun fun fun especally if they have a foam party set up.  After a whole day in the sun, dinner at Mosaic is highly recommended. Btw may I mention the amazing staff and chefs!",5,December 2020

"Our booking in Crimson was last minute, and I'm so glad we did it! Our experience from the airport was the start of everything. Airport representative assisted us to the van going to the port, staff welcomed us and headed us to the speed boat. Then, we had another van going to the resort, van amenities included bottled water and crackers, which is nice as Station 0 is not that near. We arrived at the resort and checked-in, upgraded from deluxe to Suite Sea View Room! I really did not expect it and got really surprised and got so in love when we got in the room!

"Pros: - Friendly and professional staffs.  - Modern and pleasant room with a panoramic view of the resort and beach.  - Excellent food and drinks.   Cons: - Strict health protocols not implemented. Many guests were not wearing face masks around the common areas and buffet breakfast. Some were even chatting while standing in front of the food trays - which is quite alarming since their saliva may contaminate the food which is being served to other people too. - Limited shuttle service. You need to get an e-tricycle if you want to go to different stations.  - Not the place if you want a quiet and relaxing vacation, at least for our experience.

Secondly, the cleanliness is excellent! We definitely felt the security on our entire stay in Boracay. And most of all, the station zero feeling, away from the crowded beaches of Boracay.

"Exclusivity at its finest. Everything was spot on perfect from safety procedures to service and food. We had a romantic dinner by the beach prepared by azure resto, we even requested a 4 course style. The room was really big and had a perfect view of the beach. Thank you Crimson!",5,February 2021
"I can‚Äôt really put into words how grateful I am that we booked our stay with Crimson Boracay. We missed our flight and because of that we had issues with our QR docs but the Roger from Crimson (he‚Äôs head concierge I believe) did all the research on next flight, coordination with LGU and airlines. We knew Crimson was going to make our experience great but still, we were impressed. I even had to make last minute requests at the restaurant for a birthday cake and they were all super helpful and accommodating. Unfortunately White Beach is a bit depressing right now due to lack of tourists and closed restaurants/stores and we would have been unhappy had we chosen a different resort.   Rooms are great, food is awesome. I see now why so many celebrities choose to stay in Crimson‚Ä¶",5,February 2021
"This is hands-down the most modern hotel and best infinity pool that I‚Äôve ever tried in Station 0 Boracay. Among the three large chain of hotels in Station 0 namely Shangri-la and M√∂venpick, I personally think Crimson gives its guest the best value for their money. The entire layout of the hotel is on an elevated structure making it look more clean, spacious and breathable. Their shoreline is well maintained and has fine white sand, although not as powdery as what you‚Äôd see in the touristy Station 2.   Overall, our stay was impeccable amid the limited operation because of the pandemic. I‚Äôd always pick this hotel over the other two large hotels found in Station 0 not because they offer the most affordable base room but because of their signature Crimson Hospitality.

"We stayed at this resort for 3 nights last October 2020 after the announcement that the island is now open for local tourist under GCQ areas (Manila Residents). The resort itself is absolutely breathtaking! The people who work at this resort are really exceptional hosts who simply cannot do enough to make sure your stay is special, all the staff of this resort really make it. From the courtesy call of the resort Manager Ms. Nico prior arrival, who made sure everything is ready including the reserved rooms and guided us with the island‚Äôs COVID19 Minimum Public Health standards, upon arrival w/ personalized assistance of Mr. Third, Mady & Richard, and the warmth welcome and accommodating gesture of the FO Staff Shien & Justin who made sure a seamless check-in and out.

We were a group of 12 including children and we had a great time ..... Everything was managed very well ....right from the time we got off the plane to departing again..... Staff is very friendly and tries to make your stay as comfortable as possible. Rooms are great and very well managed. Amenities are decent but very hygienic..... Food was great too and we loved candle light parties by the beach..... They really helped me celebrate my sons birthday too....  Lastly while everyone is awesome but some extra stars to Zeon who took care of us as his own family ..... Look out for him and if you have him you are in good hands. ,5,January 2021
"Our amazing stay began the moment we landed.  We were greeted by Crimson Resort staff, who took our luggage and drove us to the port area.  The short boat ride and drive to the resort were all seamless, as were the check in procedures.   We had a sea view suite which was well worth it.  The suites are generous in size and both clean and modern.  The bed was extremely comfortable with high quality bedding and pillows.  Nice touch to be gifted a sun hat, beach bag and hand sanitizer, masks, wipes! We found the entire resort to be spotlessly clean and beautiful, but it is the staff that make the real difference here.  Everyone is friendly, professional, hard working and cannot do enough to make your stay special.   Our first night we went to the fine dining restaurant, Mosaic.  I‚Ä¶",5,December 2020

"Spent the festive season at Crimson to close 2020. The stay was relaxing, sunset view was great, hygiene is at the top priority, the staffs are super friendly and attentive (especially Bee Jay, thanks!!). The desserts in Mosaic restaurant is superb. Try the Tres Leches. Station 1 and other beaches are only a short etrykes ride away and is really convenient. I enjoyed the new year party at the pool site with the bubble. Thank you for a great stay. ",5,December 2020
"Stayed in crimson Boracay for 4 nights in a sea view room. Room was large and nicely decorated. Bathroom was huge with a very nice bathtub. The beds were super comfortable and soft. The hotel itself had complete facilities- multiple pools, gym, spa, a fine dining restaurant and a more casual restaurant by the beach, free use of kayak and paddle board. The beach is very clean and not crowded. Service of their beach staff is amazing. They set up the lounge chair immediately when they spot you and as soon as you come out of the ocean, someone greets you with a beach towel. Only drawback is that there are a lot of stairs so it doesn‚Äôt seem very friendly for the elderly or for pwd. They have elevators but you still have to navigate around a bit so stairs is the best option. All in‚Ä¶",5,January 2021
I only visited my friends during their stay and they had a lot of problems. I am writing this to say that the Front Office Manager Zeon is an absolute charm and very hot he he. My friends had issues that I dare not mention but was all sorted by Zeon with amazing style and so humble. He was like a good old friend that you haven‚Äôt met in a long time and made you feel right at home. The staff are good and always smiling but the service was very slow. It takes ages to get a drink order especially in Azure. First there is no one in sight and if they do take your order it takes forever to be delivered. On 2 occasions Zeon had come to the beach to see how my friends were doing and took our orders instead. It was delivered in a snap. Mariel was amazing too. She was very quick to deliver‚Ä¶,5,December 2020
"My only major concern was our supposedly ""beachfront"" dinner at Azure Beach Club which they even advertised and promoted.  No one escorted us or informed us of what will be the arrangement be since it rained that day. We still had to call and get information. I can't blame them for the weather but it was not anymore raining at the time of our dinner and alternative arrangement was not good. There was no one at the front door of azure beach club when we arrived. We had to stand and wait. Dessert was also not fresh. It was still cold and it felt like it was in the fridge for days. The orange in the dessert was literally rotten which is a big no-no in any restaurant.   Setup of alternative beachfront dinner was also not great.

"My first time in station 0. Amenities are excellent. The room is really nice too. Breakfast selection is good. The pool staff are excellent.   The restaurant menu lunch and dinner is very limited.

They are the bridge to concierge, house keeping, room service and etc.   Day one. I check in. My request is simple since I know for the fact that thru Ms. Santos that occupancy rate is low that I can request a room near each other. Or at least the same floor.

"On the positive side, the food was good and the beach pleasant. The pools were properly maintained and the music wasn‚Äôt too loud.   On the constructive / reality-check side, the service was average throughout the resort. Confused orders or waiting an hour for our food at lunch was common for the 5 days we spent there. The rooms and general appearance of the resort was typical of most constructions in the Philippines: beautiful the first year, then a slow decay into non-care and poor maintenance. To cite a few: there were holes in the ceilings, shady staircases, poor finish in the rooms and stained sofas and towels. We had a sea view suite but the windows were so dirty that I was hard to appreciate the view without going outside.   Was it worth it considering the pandemic? Yes.‚Ä¶",3,December 2020

Just want to send my shout out to the staff. Service was impeccable. Our stay was delightful. Staff are all professional. We experienced seamless transfers and we were  well-assisted.   You do not need to leave the resort since everything you need is there. The sanitation and protocols are well implemented. Complements as well to the chef we enjoyed the food in Azure Beach Club.   I like alao this idea of a viber chat since you just need to chat on items that you need. Response time is also at par.   We will definately go back. Thank you for an enjoyable experience.,5,December 2020
"My family of 3 were quite hesitant to travel to Boracay island considering this pandemic. But upon seeing pictures of Crimson Resort, it was just too beautiful to pass up on. Thankfully we pushed thru with it and we were not disappointed. As soon as we got out of the airport, friendly and courteous staff from the resort welcomed us. The same hospitality (and more!) was given to us throughout our 5-day stay.   The resort itself was mind-blowing! It was even more beautiful than in the pictures. We got the Seaview Suite and it was the best! It was like being in the best seat in the cinema. We wake up everyday to the most breathtaking view. Our kid, until now, still calls it ‚Äúparadise‚Äù. He tells us we should go back and we will! Thank you very much to the everyone at Crimson Resort.‚Ä¶",4,December 2020

The room is impeccable with a modern confort room and a private bath tub good for 2 and the room service is fast.   Despite the pandemic, the staff are trained very well to attend to our needs while observing precautionary measures for everyone's safety.   We enjoyed our hassle free transfers from the airport to the hotel and back to the airport via their private van and jet boat.

Also, for the surprise cake, letter and souvenir. I am really touched by the sweet gesture.

Our utmost comfort was top priority for their staff. They took care of the luggages, offered some snacks and water when we got in the van. They even offered us a menu in case we want to order ahead so that food will be waiting when we get to the hotel.   Precautionary methods were observed when we arrived.

They sanitize everything and disinfect the different areas to ensure that the customers are safe. My hubby enjoyed the free use of the kayak and paddleboard.  Things to improve: 1.

"After spending a week in Crimson Mactan and paying less than 50% of the villa price in Crimson Borocay, we did expect at least the same level.  The villas were modern, however on our arrival there were no gates to the villa court. We had to insist on having the gates installed as it was breaking our privacy, people passing by could easily look into our bedroom. Instead of installing the gates the personnel decided that towels as a curtain would give us privacy. It was really pathetic for 5 star hotel. In the end we had one matching to other villas gate installed and another had a door that was not closing.  Swimming pool in one of the villas was dirty on arrival. In the 2nd villa swimming pool has not been cleaned once during our stay. All dirt was there.  In one of the villas‚Ä¶",3,December 2019
"Upon reaching Crimson Resort in Station Zero, I wasn't so impressed when we got to the lobby area. It didn't meet my expectations in terms of space or fine furniture. I didn't have a place to sit because there weren't enough seats to accommodate the guests especially during the check-in period. We had welcome drinks and a cold towel given to us though. As I was checking in, I was entertained by friendly, cheerful, and pretty front desk officer clad in a nice, attractive, powder blue uniform. Quickly, I was brought to my room and there I was, dumbfounded and amazed by the beauty of my room perfectly enough to celebrate our anniversary. Inside our room, we were given welcome desserts of sorts, a bag, and a hat equipped with a Nespresso coffee maker which made my husband so happy‚Ä¶",5,January 2020
"Stayed at Crimson hotel Boracay in CNY 2020.  Able to have an early check in.  Placed in a noisy room as hotel was under small renovation. We communicated to management and immediately solved the issue.  Staff is very profesional and caring. We had an excellent time. Beach is quiet, and beautiful.  Dinner buffet beautifully settled in the beach, and good food choices.  Beach bar opened all day, wonderful cocktails and smiling barmans.  Big list of activities to choose from.   Managers on top of everything.  We really thank you all! ",5,February 2020

"Yea, we were there at Crimson when Typhoon Ursula tore thru Boracay Island. It caught us a little bit by surprise 'cause of its intensity (signal 4) but we were in the right resort to ride it out in. The hotel was fully designed for and equipped for just this kind of thing.The concrete and rebar construction, with recessed roof line design was the perfect typhoon bunker. The island lost power, but the resorts back up power system didn't miss a beat, and we had electric the entire time. The even continued room service delivery of food. That was amazing!! I just can't say enough good things about the way the staff handled that situation, and made it comfortable for all of us staying there. The Typhoon came and went in one day, and our trip was just awesome as Crimson just handled‚Ä¶",5,December 2019
"The resort was beyond pristine, well kept and fantastic! The rooms are luxurious and the staff was very hospitable. I had the best time even though I was sick for 2 days. I had an incident in which I lost my bracelet.

They were able to find my bracelet and handled the situation with the utmost profession. I can definitely say I will be coming back!",5,December 2019
"Stayed at Crimson Hotel for 5 days during Christmas vacation. first let me begin with a big thanks to all the staff in the hotel who provide all the necessary assistance to make our vacation such a pleasant one. the welcoming was so nice. the hotel is so big and modern. rooms are spacious, staff are helpful, the breakfast is such amazing with alot of varieties, the beach is not so big but private and next to Movenpick and Shangri La (you can use any of the beaches).

The staff are all well trained and attentive- we never had to wait very long to receive service for anything. I met Mr. Henz, the duty manager and he was professional and cooperative with our requirements. He really did his best to help us to have amazing staying. I really appreciate his efforts. I wouldn't hesitate in recommending this resort to anyone looking for a quiet getaway in paradise & we hope to be back soon!",5,January 2020
We stayed at the Mactan and then the Boracay hotels. It was simply fantastic. Thank you to Mr. Zein Front Office manager. He met us in arrival at the beach and walked on the water to help my mother from the boat even though he got wet. This kind of gesture I did not see anywhere. When we checked out he even did the blessing to my parents which we do for our elders and he is I think from Brazil not Pinot. Usually the manager will stand at tell his people to do things but not this man. Azure food was fantastic and Raj is the best. Thank you Mr. Roger to help find my bags. There was one guy at the Hennan Center who gave my kids Origami. That was so sweet of him. My kids loved it and now started trying to make it themselves. Gelo and Chris thank you for taking care of us. Amanda is‚Ä¶,5,January 2020
"Our family spent 22 private villa nights at Crimson in Boracay and on Cebu island. Crimson Boracay was seemingly of better quality but spoiled by numerous minor issues and poor service execution.  Transfer from airport took 2 hours by boat because of poor planning.   Getting out of the hotel proved difficult as drivers simply were not available to take one up the 700m steep drive in 30+ degree heat.  Our villa pool was never cleaned during our stay and for 2 days unusable as workmen were present fixing issues. Air conditioning failed and the fan was without a remote. Doors wouldn‚Äôt open, close or had to be installed during our stay. Keys had to returned to reception for reprogramming. So many minor issues spoilt our stay.

"This property is gorgeous.  Wish the service matched it.  We went in a big group ( all families) & booked for 19 people of which 17 showed up for the trip.   We made our bookings for December in March and requested for adjacent suites so that the kids could walk freely from one room to the other instead of us having to escort them. I think that‚Äôs a fairly simple request, made well in advance, which was not granted.  Instead we were scattered.   The sheets had blood stains and no bathroom supplies were replenished ( including towels) unless we asked.  One lady at the front desk was downright rude and obnoxious.  They tried their best to make us pay for additional breakfasts for the kids despite us telling them that the cost was included in our booking rate & that some people‚Ä¶",2,December 2019
"The staff were the best! Better trained than other 5 star resorts in the area. The food was good as well. Everyone made sure that we enjoyed our stay.  I would have given 5 stars if not for the issues my husband and I had while checking in.   As soon as we arrived, we were informed that we had no guaranteed room as the credit card used to reserve the room did not belong to us. I was so surprised because we booked the hotel months before our vacation, why weren‚Äôt we informed way before we arrived? The credit card used (I never had a problem with it EVER), was in my maiden name. Things were ironed out when I showed them the card used. Then we proceeded to our room and waited for our luggage to follow. My husband had to go back looking for our luggage as no one was attending to it.‚Ä¶",4,November 2019
"Boracay is our regular vacation destination, and Crimson Resort truly was the best to date. From taking care of us the moment we landed in Caticlan, providing exceptional customer experience once we arrived at the resort, to taking us back to the airport.  We stayed at the Villa suites which was very impressive. Room, bathroom and living space was spacious and immaculate. A bonus was having a Villa host (MJ) who truly made our experience memorable. One time we briefly talked about just wanting to relax and enjoy a bubble bath, that night she organised this for my son along with turn over treats. This really made us feel like we were taken care of. (Thanks MJ).  Situated in Station 1, it's a quiet resort, great for relaxation.

"The hotel is simply amazing. Even though it was booked out and quite crowded given winter holidays, it managed to preserve its charm and beauty. Even though we are a young couple and prefer adult only hotels, Crimson (being super family friendly) was still absolutely amazing. Food - exquisite (Tom Yan Goong soup mmmmm), amenities - superb, service - impeccable. One suggestion for future guests - take the sea view rooms - worth the money 100%. As for the Spa - i think this was the best massage of my life. The only suggestion is to speed up the transfer, we waited almost an hour for the speedboat given they have a particular schedule. But this minor ‚Äúbut‚Äù was immediately forgotten once we got to the resort. Private Beach is stunning! Also, not worth going to the Stations, they are‚Ä¶",5,January 2020
"A typhoon is not usually something you want associated with a vacation. We arrived at Crimson on Dec 28, only days after the resort was hit by a strong typhoon. The staff did an amazing job making sure that the luxury resort operated at near perfection for all guests, even while staff quarters had no power or water. The hotel was fully operational on generators and other than no WiFi or cell service for a few days, one would never know that most of the island was still in recovery mode without power.   -The beach is a perfect 10, as is the attentive service from Bee Jay.

"This smallish gem is only a year old, and still smoothing out some of the operations. We took a family villa for the peak holiday week that included the New Year celebration. The villa was clean and new, nicely appointed and large enough for our kids to stay in the living room while we were in the master BR. Next time I would request a villa further from the main pool, which draws a crowd especially for the spectacular sunsets, and was outside our door.   The food was very good with 2 restaurant options. The bar was lovely, but for whatever reason drink making was glacial.   The 2 main positive aspects were the staff, which was friendly and warm. A genuinely kind team of people.

While having breakfast we were entertained by Ray who have been very nice, the food selections are very good too. Mosaic offered the best view of the sunset while we relax and drink their well selected wines.

"Our stay at Crimson Boracay was fantastic. Their service is top-notch, making sure that we were well taken care of all throughout our stay. The staff are all well trained and attentive- we never had to wait very long to receive service for anything from water, towels to cocktails on the beach. Our toddler (3years) had a great time too. The resort is very kid-friendly, providing many beach toys and floaters for him to play with. The beach is clean and well kept. I couldn‚Äôt ask for more from a resort. ",5,November 2019

Upon our airport arrival, we were greeted with a ‚Äúgreat afternoon!‚Äù from the Crimson staff who promptly led us to the speedboat that brought us to Station Zero. Our arrival at the hotel greeted us with native drums music, dalandan juice, cool towels and welcome bracelet. Made me feel like Crimson was an oasis after a difficult travel. We were promptly checked in, with the first round of mini bar free and some local treats as welcome snacks. We got a free nicely designed cloth bag to carry our valuables while we enjoyed the beach.

The dinner by the beach arrangements capped off our last night in the resort and was a truly memorable one especially for my brother-in-law celebrating his birthday.   They offer a lot of activities whether indoor or outdoor, I enjoyed the kayak and paddle board in particular.  The kids enjoyed their stay in the game room, hope they consider extending operating hours beyond 5 PM, though.

"To start off, the staff, accommodation, and the experience at the Crimson has been breathtaking. From the start to the very end has been the most remarkable experience I've ever had in Asia. It wasn't because of the cleanliness of the rooms, or the scenery, but it was because of the two staff remembers that provided excellent service and information during our stay. Chris, the shuttle driver was one of the most friendliest person we encountered in Boracay. He provided local guidance and gave us some tips for us to make our trip the most memorable.

What seriously amazed us about this place is the level of service they provide. We'd like to single-out 'Bee-Jay' and 'Henry' from the beach who made sure we were very well taken cared of.

We planned for this holiday months back to celebrate their birthdays in October.  I had a very good experience in Crimson Cebu where I stayed twice.  The facilities did not disappoint.  Big rooms with breath-taking view of the ocean!  I love the free tote bag and hat they provided (very useful).  I would've rated this 5 if not for the transportation issues.  On our first day in the resort, we went to the main beach (D Mall) to have dinner.  We rode the tricycle going there as there was no available shuttle at that time.  Going back, we waited 40 minutes so we can use the shuttle as it was very inconvenient to travel by tricycle because we're a family‚Ä¶",4,October 2019

Without it, the only way to go to the main strip is to ride a trike where it‚Äôs hot and be exposed to terrible air pollution. Unfortunately, their shuttle service is a JOKE. Because Crimson advertised that they have free shuttle service, I didn‚Äôt mind its far location, which is why I booked. But when I got here, I (along with 7 other people who were travelling with me) were hugely disappointed by their very infrequent shuttle service (only 5 services: 10am, 3pm, 8pm, 10pm, in a day!).

Kids zone is more than a just a simple room, and we appreciated ladies actively playing with children (thanks Fiona & colleagues).

The private beach and the amazing infinity pool was great to relax. Will definitely come here again on my next trip to Boracay.",5,August 2019
"Excellent stay with brilliant service: The highlight of the stay, Beejay who welcomes you with towels when you ascend from the magnificent waters of the private beach and arranges a sunbed  under the palm trees when it is too windy for sun umbrellas. The DJ at the beach bar makes you want to sip cocktails and enjoy food and company until early morning. The hotel is superb, but the service makes the place unique. Eating fresh seafood at the beachfront restaurant Azure with the longest happy hour in all the island makes the place memorable! Ray ay the breakfast Saffron restaurant gives you a true Philippines experience.  Delicious! You feel at home.",5,August 2019
"The resort is excellent, with warm and nice staffs, good facilities for play in the resort even the weather is not good during our stay. The resort is far from Dmall, and there is not enough shuttle bus.",5,August 2019
From the moment we walked out of the airport terminal until we returned a few days later the service and experience was top notch.  The staff was all smiles and extremely informative and helpful in all regards.  The property was in immaculate shape with a beautiful private beach and breath taking pools!  We can't wait to return!,5,August 2019
"Incredible location and premises.Stunning beach and pools,and the room was absolutely amazing. Seriously, it was money well spent and i couldnt be happier for choosing Station zero over 2 or 3 in Boracay. The real highlight and surprise for me was the fusion cuisine we`ve tasted at the ""Mosaic"" Restaurant though. Chef Pablo`s food was nothing short of spectacular and eye opening. We are a well traveled foodie couple and we had to keep coming back for that amazing menu every night.  Even if you choose not to stay at Crimson Boracay that,s a must go place for delicious food if you are in the area. Cleanliness: if you are picky, you will see stuff ...Housekeeping is not 5 Star ( but far from bad...) and judging by the breakfast buffet, their target customer is mostly the chinese‚Ä¶",5,August 2019
I stayed here with my children 3 nights. Unfortunately it was rainy season on Boracay island. Only one day we could enjoy all pools this hotel has day and night. The accommodations were all good including its spa and the staffs were all very kind. We had a good time especially thanks to Mitch at the Spanish and Mexican restaurant in the hotel. One thing I can say for your information and you have to know is that the hotel guests were almost Chinese or Korean.,4,August 2019
"We stayed for two weeks at Crimson, Boracay for our honeymoon in February 2019. It is safe to say that my husband and I have never missed a place more. White sands, clear waters, sunny weather, great food and a fantastic hotel.  From the moment we arrived at the airport, the Crimson staff were extremely helpful and made our transfer to the hotel seamless.   When we arrived at Crimson, we felt like we were in a special place, and that we were very welcomed guests. This didn't change throughout the rest of the holiday. The staff were always extremely helpful. Special thanks to Rolly, Yuosh (Bell), Beejay and Danica who made our stay extra special!  The location of the hotel is perfect, it's nice to get out of the hustle and bustle of White Beach, and come away to the sanctuary‚Ä¶",5,February 2019

The environment and location are incredible with the resort nestled in a cove with a semi private beach, spectacular views and surroundings.   During our stay/wedding in Crimson there was a misunderstanding with our room booking which was included in our wedding package.

But some couple with us from crimson resort left before us as soon as arrived the port. The couple had other company's sending service. And some other group tour passengers who arrived at the port after us left before us. Finally the van came to us the condition was worse than pickking us up from Kalibo.

"Too expensive yet the service don't match the rate. Upon arrival at the port, their representative asked for our hotel confirmation which they have them handy and ready. When we arrived the hotel, we were just asked to stay in a Library but the next group were given an orientation. Our group should have been oriented as well instead of asking us to stay in a Library doing nothing. They should have a specific process for group check-in and should be different from individual check-in.",3,August 2019

I especially want to thank Caloy and Ray for letting me try the delicious local pastries during our breakfasts, as well as Third for welcoming us and helping us with transportation during our stay. The swimming pools were very well taken care off; the children certainly enjoyed their daytime and evening swims. Unfortunately we didn‚Äôt get to enjoy much of the beach due to stronger than normal winds, but the view is downright amazing. We will definitely be coming back again!

"It is very easy to write a five star review when the weather is perfect and the sun is shining.  However, you start to separate the top properties when the weather is not perfect and the conditions are less than ideal.  Boracay in late July experiences a wide range of weather patterns. From sunny clear skies to monsoon like conditions which we got to experience firsthand during a trip to DMall.  Fortunately, crimson had a couple of vans available to help transport their guests out of the torrential downpour. A special thanks to Chris who was the driver that evening.

We were the only guests to arrive in the morning and we were told that the van was delayed due to traffic. We were the last ones to leave the airport and even our plane was leaving when the van finally show up. It then took 10 mins to get to the hotel boat.  As we were early and the only guest to arrive in the morning the check-in was quite fast. The room was ready and we were to get it in the morning.

I've been to Boracay enough times for me to be able to say that this is the best place to stay if you want a hassle-free vacation. Everything will be provided for that you will not even want to leave the place and go to the other stations.  The only downside would be the distance from the other attractions of Boracay island. The transport service will take you there but honestly, you wouldnt need it. The pristine waters of the Punta Bunga beach will allow you to swim, bathe, and drink your troubles away, thanks to the Azure bar.   Ive got to give special mention to the staff hospitality.

The hotel offers excellent structure to enjoy the beach: plenty of tables, chairs, beds and hammocks, beach toys for children, as well as kayaks, paddle board and snorkels.

The transport to hotel from the airport and Jetty took a long Time.  The cold towel to refresh smelled like sewage.  The rooms were nice and modern.

I love the Pool foam party with unlimited BBQ & drinks every Saturday where kids can truly enjoy, for only 2,200 if you're a guest of the hotel. I am inlove with this place and we are planning to go back again :)",5,June 2019
"Beautiful crystal clear waters, amazing modern hotel. The foam party was a surprise and fun. Food is beautiful. About at 10 minute tricycle ride to station 3 and 4 - Boracay beach is just stunning. Hawkers are everywhere but fun to deal with. Haggle them down! 5 days is probably enough. ",5,June 2019
"I stayed with my family for 4d/3n. We were a group of 7 adults and 3 kids ages 3 and 2. The hotel staff was able to accommodate all our requests especially when it came to the needs of the kids. The staff were courteous and attentive. The facilities were great, both for kids and adults. The wifi was also fast, so plus points for that.   Overall, good value for money and I‚Äôd definitely go back. ",5,June 2019

"Stayed in Crimson for three nights and the overall experience was great! The staff was very accommodating and friendly with their warm greetings. The suite was well situated with a private pool and the bed was very comfortable. The location of the property was great and was raving about the welcome experience wherein their own speedboat will pick you up from the entry point straight to the resort. The concierge team was very attentive to the customer's needs and even anticipates the things that we need. The breakfast buffet was lavish and delicious. Although when we had lunch once, the chicken was not well cooked so have to get their attention about it, otherwise the food was good. Although it is expensive to stay there being a high end resort, it is expected that the resort‚Ä¶",5,June 2019
"It was a pleasant stay at Crimson Boracay! The rooms and amenities were superb.  - Very polite staff, willing to go out of their way just to accommodate your concerns and needs. Special mention to Rey and Jocelyn of Saffron Dining, Third and Renz of transpo services, staff from the main pool bar and the life guards of the pool and beach areas. Last but not the least our house keeper at Aqua building. - Very clean, detailed and well appointed rooms deserving to be called a 5 star beach/resort hotel. - Staff never failed to greet you with anytime of the day with a smile! They worked/performed their duties with grace under pressure. - If i will go back in Boracay, i will definitely stay ‚Äúagain‚Äù at Crimson. Indeed, a home away from home!!",5,June 2019
"The stay we had was amazing. Starting off with their cozy room that came with a stunning sea view. The bed was so comfortable that it made it hard to rise up in the morning. Speaking of mornings, you wouldn‚Äôt want to miss their international breakfast buffet. During our breakfast we were greeted with attentive staff (shoutout to: Ray & Vette), and a variety of food choices. I‚Äôll definitely miss the healthy shots.   After a scrumptious breakfast you can try out their recreational activities ( free of charge!) and while basking under the sun their attentive staff such as Joey and Jun of Azure will offer you a refreshing cold towels followed by some fresh cut fruits.   A great way to pass the time, especially waiting for the sunset would be staying and dining at Azure beach club.‚Ä¶",5,June 2019
"The hotel experience was stellar. Definitely a great choice if you have money to spend. My favorite parts of the stay were the grand cuisine, the many recreational activities (which was free), the relaxing hotel room with intuitive room service, attentive employees, and the overall treatment of me and my family.  The location of the hotel could either be beneficial or detrimental to your stay as it‚Äôs quite isolated from the hustle and bustle of the city. However, if you still want to visit the locations like D‚Äômall and Citymall, they provide a free scheduled shuttle service for your transportation needs. In my opinion, I‚Äôd much prefer an isolated oasis than a hotel near the crowded and noisy main locations in Boracay, so the location is a plus for me.   In summary, definitely a‚Ä¶",5,June 2019

The location is incredible the private beach is the most beautiful I have ever seen and facilities catered to all needs including gym, watersports, library, day spa and transport services to other parts of island.

To be honest, at first we were a bit skeptical as it seemed quite secluded but staying here was a great decision.   We were picked up by Vincci who waited for us while we got everything ready from the hotel we were checking out from and with a huge smile and wonderful conversation he drove us to Crimson Resort.   From the minute we arrived, we were greeted with huge smiles with every member of staff trying their best to ensure we have everything we needed.

"Private beach, nice resort  Unaccommodating and disjointed front desk (I.e inconsistent and inefficient transfer scheduling) and gym personnel   I had high hopes for this resort. Quality of service needs to be amped up to be considered a 5-star hotel.  The staff always replies with ‚Äúcertainly‚Äù but doesn‚Äôt really know if the request can be accommodated with absolute certainty. What a joke and disappointment. Don‚Äôt train your staff as robots.  Initially, I was going to recommend this place to family and friends. But the service just got worse day by day which left me quite infuriated!",3,June 2019
"We stayed at the Suite with a sea view - very spacious and can comfortably accommodate a family of 4. It has a balcony and a stunning view of the entire resort. The restaurants (Saffron Cafe, Mosaic, Azure) offered a wide variety of food. We were made to feel very welcome from the very moment we stepped onto Caticlan airport. Hospitality starts from arrival to departure. Service at its very best! Well done! I highly recommend staying here if you crave for a quiet, restful and relaxing time in Boracay. Definitely going back there!",5,May 2019
Service and room cleanliness were superb. They even arranged a special surprise for my sister who's celebrating her birthday there. They have the one of the best pools in Boracay I must say. I would definitely come back and recommend this hotel.,5,May 2019

"Modern 4/5 star hotel with great staff, great beach and reasonable pricing. Especially the beach bar / catering are good (very reasonable prices and good lunch snacks!!), and the F&B team is super friendly. More than enough space on the beach and fee paddle board/kayak rental, slightly invasive security/safety guard presence but at least you feel safe all the time. Free shuttle to downtown, but with an odd gap between 5.30 and 8.30 pm. Only place I ve ever been in the Philippines that isn't able to serve a fresh coconut :) Would be nice to have glass bottles for drinking water instead of myriads of small plastic bottles in the room. Blinds have gaps so if you like to sleep in darkness better bring an eyemask. Other than that, a perfect and recommendable stay! Thanks to Lorenzo‚Ä¶",5,May 2019
"For all the beautiful pictures of Crimson you could see online, the actual product does not disappoint.   Here are the things I loved:  - gorgeous Azure beach club with the best happy hour in all of Boracay (I‚Äôm surprised how inexpensive drinks come out to be; less than 100 pesos for a beer and 150 for cocktails made of top notch ingredients)  - excellent service (friendly managers and staff; special mention to Dan the bartender who adjusted our drinks to my preferences perfectly)  -authentic chicken tandoori in Azure  - the best breakfast buffet (Saffron Cafe) spread I‚Äôve come across in recent memory (think international cuisine with a to-die-for lineup of dessert and pastry offerings).

From pick up at the airport, to check-in, the cleanliness of the room, the dining experience, the BEACH! and until check-out. It was wonderful. The staff at the hotel was amazingly accommodating. The hotel have shuttle services going to other points in island which was very convenient. They have large ball rooms which can accommodate a lot of people and the staff is always ready to assist you. I felt like I was in a private beach since only a few people were there when I was having a swim. The next time I come to Boracay, I would definitely stay at Crimson!",5,May 2019
I visited the resort today and i find great experience. From Security to Reception the staff are accomodating and helpful. I passed by with Mosaic Restaurant and the restaurant design is awesome same with Saffron.    I ordered Basil Mojito at Azure and  I found out that the ingredients are came from GM‚Äôs garden.

Traveling with 2 energeic toddlers is very challenging but to my surprise, we all had a wonderful & smooth 7 days stay at this gorgeous resort last April. They have everything for everyone, the resort is designed meticulously with top- notch facilities. No window for boredom as my kids juggle between beach activities in the morning, Crimzone( kids play area) & swimming pools.

We were booked in Villa 119 and had a nice beach and pool views. The suite was not bad at all. We love the fruits especially the mangoes in our room. Although we booked 3 adults in each room, they only prepared 2 sets of bathrobe and amenities.

"Together with my husband and 2 kids, we stayed at Crimson Boracay for 3 nights. From the booking/reservation, i got quick replies from them. Upon arrival, we were attended to immediately and since that day was a little gloomy, they thought of another way to bring us to the resort thru shorter boat ride because i have a 1-yr old baby with me. We felt good staying at Crimson Boracay. There are other hotels/staff who will give more attention to foreign guests. But at Crimson, we felt at home. We were treated nicely. Everyone at there was good at what they‚Äôre doing. A best place to stay if you‚Äôre with kids. It felt safe and exclusive. I‚Äôd be glad to go back At Crimson Boracay.",5,May 2019

We were blessed enough to witness a man proposing to his soon to be wife. The hotel had set the couple up with an extremely romantic dinner on the beach at sunset. It was amazing to watch the staff go to such lengths to accommodate them. Also during our brief stay, we got to meet 2 famous Filipino entertainers; an actor and a musician.

There were plugs for hairdryers and cel phones at strategic places. I think they designed this room thinking of women.   The curtains were remotely controlled which of course were very comfortable when opening the windows in the morning. Talking about views- the room stands on top of a hill that overlooks the blue sea.

The food and drinks were what I expected - good and overpriced, as they always are in a higher-end hotel. That wasn‚Äôt the issue.   For starters the resort is isolated. I knew this when I chose it, but didn‚Äôt realize how far it was from the main area of Boracay. The resort offers a free shuttle, but it runs every 1.5 hours and only takes 10 people.

"We spent 4 days at Crimson and had a good time. The location provides a little more privacy from the main beach. It doesnt have the finishes of a 5 star resort, our room fan would turn on and off randomly with no remedy, black out curtains didnt really block the sunlight and the restaurants were mediocre. But the staff were very friendly and tried to accommodate when possible. ",4,April 2019

Shout out to Danicca, Archie, Jonil, Tamae, JUN, Jomar of the azure bar; to Bee Jay and Joshua of the beach front for their warm service ( to Chef Rajesh for the yummy food; to Nikki for the wonderful check in and out experience. And of course to GM Laurent for being on top of it all. Amenities and facilities are world class too! Will definitely be back! Really couldn‚Äôt get enough of Crimson.",5,April 2019
"Absolute Perfection!!! The staff were very humble, sincere and offered  to help in whatever way you required. The resort is kept spotless. There is an ample amount of facilities for all guest, even during peak season. Their service rating should be high than 5 stars,   Sunset was my favorite time of the day. Will definitely be back.

"Room is big enough for family of 4.  A private beach front if you don't like to mingle at Stations 1, 2 which are a bit far from this place; you either take an e-trike or book for their shuttle to the different stations.  Overall, a good place to relax.",5,April 2019
"  ‚ûï The location was fabulous. The hotel is beautiful. We loved the beach and the super friendly staff. The beer and cocktails were fantastic value for money. The overall cost was in line with our expectations although they added tax and service charge to every bill so the prices are misleading.   ‚ûñ The service speed was very hit and miss, it could be very slow sometimes. Some of the evening waitresses didn‚Äôt know how to serve wine or that bread and drinks should be served promptly on arrival, and we rarely received all the meals together. One evening we had one of the main courses served before the starter. Its not their fault, it‚Äôs poor training.  The restaurant menus should have been distinctively different but they weren‚Äôt. Not enough hanging space for clothes in wardrobe.  ",4,April 2019
"One of the best resort I have visited.The receptionists were really helpful and friendly. Great staff who knew how to serve the customer. The room was well equipped and the service was excellent. From our villa, we could view the sea and feel the cool breeze. The location of our villa was absolutely perfect,very clean and clear water, a very good place to relax and chill. The scenery was beautiful.The view of the sunset from that point was mesmerizing. I must say the location of the resort is at best place of¬†Boracay.",5,April 2019

We were absolutely blown away  by the resort itself, the service, the bar and beach restaurant - Azure, the breakfasts at Saffron, the views of the ocean, the sunsets, the list goes on.  The experience starts from the very beginning. You're met at the airport by staff, whisked away to the wharf where a speedboat takes you straight to the private beach to be welcomed by the drummers and resort staff. You're met with a bracelet, a refresher towel, an iced tea and lots of smiles. After the intro to the room and services, it's down to the beach for complimentary kayak, snorkelling gear, SUP, and beach games.

When we arrived at the hotel we were greeted by the hotel staff with iced tea and cold towels.   When our suite was ready, a hotel staff member walked us to our suite and showed us all the cool automatic features of our room.

It has it's pros and cons, but I think it will depend on your personality, but if you are into a quiet and reflective type of vacation, crimson is definitely the resort for you.  The breakfast buffet was delightful, it has an exquisite selection of cuisine but I really enjoyed the cured meat and cheeses. Staffs in Saffron are very accomodating for all our requests so as the beachfront staff (hi miss Pamela!).

Even we encountered a problem in our villa during our 3rd night, you can't think of the hassle and negativity at all because the crews and resident managers are all solution-oriented. Salute to the whole Management and my sincere appreciation to all of you guys! We are definitely coming back.

We were delighted that the seaview room we got was very spacious and modernly interiored. The breakfast buffet was excellent! There were a lot of activities we were able to try along the beach like snorkling, volleyball etc. But the thing we enjoyed the most was the entertainment room where we had karaoke. :) I guess the only thing i would want them to improve is the number of shuttle going to dmall, it‚Äôs very limited. In fact we had to use e-trycicle because they couldn‚Äôt accomodate us. Nevertheless, we were very satisfied with our stay and will definitely come back, probably getting the pool villa next time.",5,March 2019

"I stayed 3 nights on Chinese New year Holiday  I really liked the spot and view of the resort, it was new and had a nice beach  also the design was gorgeous  unfornutately the hotel system was terrible and not well matured  first of all, our arrival time was 1:30 p.m.   I tried to check-in but the manual check-in time was 3p.m. so I couldnt  I understood abt that but even when it was 3.p.m.   we couldnt check-in our room because of not prepared..  we waited for one more hour and finally on 4p.m. we checked-in our room  I cannot understand why there room cleaning was not finished even the check-in time was passed.   and also on the check out day  the hotel told me our transportation will be ready on 6p.m.  so we went to the lobby exactly on 6.p.m  but the car was not ready  and‚Ä¶",1,February 2019
"This is a satisfactory accommodation in all respects, except that the waiting time was long for admission.   The swimming pool, meal, room condition, service, and private beach were so beautiful.  I also felt happy while I was staying with the kindness and smile of my employees.  I was nervous because I missed my Sanding reservation to return to Korea by mistake, but with the calmness and help of the Crimson Resort staff, I was able to return to Korea on a flight leaving for Korea at the appointed time.  Thank you to the Crimson Resort staff.",5,February 2019
"My friends (from USA) and I (party of 4) visited Boracay and stayed at Crimson.   During check-in, they have greeted us like ‚Äúhawaii style‚Äù except for the garland :) we just had delays on checking in (15mins) to make sure that the our rooms are fully ready for us and they were apologetic about it. While waiting, we just hangout at the shore-amazing view :)  The rooms are amazing, very relaxing and nice view. The facilities in the room are topnotch.  Restaurants have good food and we have enjoyed our buffet (breakfast) and the rest of the meal at Mosaic (another resto there)  All staff are accomodating, while we are hanging out at the shore, they are making sure if we want to order any drinks (any kind) and as soon as we get off from swimming someone‚Äôs already there to give us‚Ä¶",5,January 2019
"Location at station zero gave me the feeling of serenity.  The property‚Äôs management of cleanliness on the beach and coastline takes on the continued hope that the thick, powdered white sand can be maintained.  The cabanas were located far from the water to create a feeling of privacy and to allow a better and wider view of the coastline. There was a variety selection of food.  Service Staff were friendly & attentive. Music was awesome and they even provided 2 DJ‚Äôs to ‚Äúmix‚Äù live music.  Rooms and bathrooms were spacious unlike other deluxe rooms I‚Äôve stayed at in Boracay with surprise gifts welcoming the customers.  The moment we were received at the airport, we felt like VIP‚Äôs having been met & greeted by 3 uniformed staff.  I would love to go back again someday!",5,February 2019
"From the time we arrived until the we left, we were accomodated with superior hospitality by the staff.  It is a quiet, beautiful place to visit.  We hope to return with our kids, in-laws, and grand-kids next year!",5,November 2018
"My kids loved it so much that during the whole trip, they were asking when we can come back!  We stayed here from Monday 11/25 thru Friday 12/1/18.  The property is beautiful, but not every single part of it was operational, ie spa and one of the roof top pools.  This is the only reason for the 4 star and not 5 star review.  The hospitality at this resort is hands down 5 stars.  We can not say how they truly listened and responded even without requesting it from them.  They had nuts in the room upon arrival, but one of my sons has a severe nut allergy.  Extended family was starving and ate all of the nuts in the room.  My son started having an allergic reaction in the lobby.  Nikki saw what was happening.  She took the initiative to change all of the sheets, and had the room‚Ä¶",4,November 2018
"Went to Crimson to relax for a few days after 3 weeks of nonstop events around the Philippines. From arrival all the way to departure, our experience was amazing! The service and hospitality of the people are incredible. The resort is very clean as well as all of the facilities. The food is great! There is nothing more you could ask for. 100% would recommend if you are looking for a quiet place to relax since the beach is secluded. However, I would suggest entertainment at night for guests :) overall, a great resort!",5,January 2019
"As I write this review, I am currently at another hotel on Boracay and am incredibly saddened that the last part of my holiday has been spoiled by having to leave the Crimson. After spending two nights and being upgraded to a Suite, we had to leave due to the hotel being fully booked. We tried to reach out to the hotel to see if we could arrange a reservation, but they only had super expensive rooms available that we could not afford. (We are on teachers‚Äô salaries.) We miss this hotel incredibly and our experience of Boracay just isn‚Äôt the same after staying at this luxurious place, so we are writing this review from our current hotel on Boracay.   Comparing the Crimson to our current hotel, Hennan Palm Beach Resort, the food is a much better quality with better food options.‚Ä¶",5,February 2019
"From the moment we arrived in Boracay, Crimson did an A+ job at making our stay hassle-free and enjoyable.  Once we arrived in the Crimson van at the resort, we were greeted with cold towels and a cup of delicious iced tea. The views in the lobby of the property and beach were very inviting! We were promptly checked in and escorted to our room. They took care to show us around our room, the complimentary mini-bar options, the gifts provided by the resort, and information on the resort.   We stayed in a one-bedroom suite overlooking the beach and we were nothing short of impressed. The rooms are new and well-appointed, and they take full advantage of the views with floor-to-ceiling windows in the living room and bedroom.

We have stayed in this resort for 5 nights after 3 weeks in Philippines and other islands but this place can be brand new as establishment but the staff is not for this resort. There is a mark at the sheets from day first so in 5 days never change the sheets or pillow cases unbelievable when you pay so much money not even one time. We booked transfer to DMALL 4 hours before the schedule departure from the front desk so when we get there they put us to wait in one sofa and they forget us there for one hour so after they realize that we were still there they did meeting with the other staff and took us a private car from resort to drive us.

Extremely polite staff all around and rooms are clean and have all the modern facilities. Had a good massage at the spa center too after all the swim . Had the most fantastic family bonding time at Crimson . Loved every seconds of our stay there.

"Me and my boyfriend recently visited the Crimson and we just loved every second. Highly recommend and we will definitely be back. After a 26 hour journey from the UK we were greeted by the kindest and most genuine staff who were always on hand to help if we needed. The food was fantastic, especially the breakfast buffet, which we usually skip at hotels due to poor quality. The freshest and most versatile breakfast buffet. The rooms are modern, stylish and clean. The pools on site are fantastic with the best views of the bay. The beach is beautiful and the free water-sports was an added bonus. We can't wait to go back! Thank you Crimson for a stay to remember.",5,January 2019
Stayed at Crimson Boracay last January 21 to 23. Very accommodating and friendly staff. Greeted and welcomed us with drinks and flower necklace. Nice facilities.

My wife and I are residents of Boracay and held our wedding at Crimson this past weekend.  Even though it was a small wedding we received exceptional service from start to finish.  They treated us as if we were inviting 500 guests to the wedding.  From GM Laurent to the F&B director Michael and Manager Ria at the Mosaic Restaurant they went above and beyond to make sure we had a memorable experience.  Every request we made was accommodated without question and the follow up was very quick and professional.  executive Chef Pablo at the Mosaic Latin American restaurant created our custom menu which was the best food we've eaten in the Philippines over the past 6 years we've lived here.

"Given that Crimson is one of the exclusive resorts in the island, ofc you would expect an excellent service, facilities and such. And guess what? they did! They will give you the vacation experience you are dreaming of. But what makes them different from other resorts? They provide  relationship to their guests that gives us comfort and makes us feel special, which is very important to us since we came as a group with a high profile partners.  Just by thinking the transfers you'll be having upon arrival to Caticlan, you'll get yourself stressed already. But Crimson made it easy for us, from The airport to resort you have to get a 5 min van to Henann Lounge and then 5 min speedboat to Cagban and lastly a 30 min van to the resort.

Food was delicious and of exceptional quality - 7 courses!  We couldn't have asked for anything more.

The resort has a nice beach area beside 2 other luxury hotels. It was not as we expected though. Not a good idea if you want some peace and quiet during the holidays. A lot of noise around the building from chickens and music from next door neighbor. They still have some building works to be done and service can still be improved. The staff are nice but need to be more knowledgeable of the food as i tried to ask about the drinks in azure and sometimes they dont know what's in them. Food are just ok and pricey with still limited menu so you can go to stations 1 to 3 for food as an option. The spa experience was the most memorable for me as they offered pregnancy massage.,2,December 2018

I must have changed my room 3 times in total and every time the room was changed, she was patient and replied accordingly with all the information I had requested.

Such a shame because the beach is the single best feature of the resort!  You are actually better off saving a vast amount of money by staying in a low budget hotel and going to the public beach at the other stations ‚Äì it will actually be quieter than this 'exclusive resort'  It was so noisy on the beach because of the music so we decided to move to another of the hotel pools 150-200 meters away inland but we could still hear and also feel the vibrations of the bass from the sound‚Ä¶",1,December 2018

We made numerous calls to reception and the staff were lovely and happy to help us but it was so annoying to have to keep calling them. The air con went off at least 3 times and i got a bit upset with the staff. The balcony in our room was tiny and no chair to sit on. There was no resort/guest folder in the room so we had no idea who to call for what and‚Ä¶",4,November 2018

The general manager Mr Laurent and his team were all kind, professional, and accommodating. Mike & I will continue to support this paradise in Boracay! See you again! Sending our love from Singapore! :-)",5,November 2018
"I am a frequent Boracay visitor, visiting the island 3 to 4 times a year. I prefer to stay in top hotels to experience full comfort during my vacation. For this visit I choose to stay in the newly opened luxury hotel in the  island. Modern and chic designs, beautiful interiors, exterior and impeccable service. First impression that I have on my first stay.   Our boat and land transfers from the airport to the resort is comfortable. Our car driver Jaime is friendly yet professional, he almost became a personal driver facilitating my arrival and departure to/from the hotel. He  was also the driver during my transfer to D‚ÄôMall goin back to the resort. He is such a happy man happily doing his job. Lobby ambassador Rose greeted us with a lovely smile offering our welcome drinks and‚Ä¶",5,November 2018
"Hands down the best resort in Boracay Service was impeccable, rooms and facilities super modern and clean, and the private beach and the pool was amazing. Most importantly everyone was super nice and welcoming. Would definitely recommend to anyone planning to travel to Boracay",5,November 2018
"Crimson Resort is a little piece of heaven. The staff are all delightful, super friendly and helpful. The room is spacious and clean. You will get a little surprise gift of tote bag and hat which is perfect for Boracay. Crimson is a delightful resort. Love the private beach right in front of the swimming  pool. I can‚Äôt tell you how delightful this resort is. Recommended for families and couples!",5,November 2018
I didn‚Äôt stay here I just ate lunch and the view was worth it! ate the pineapple burger and it was surprisingly delicious! They also have a happy hour from 10am to 12 midnight! 50 percent off on drinks! My lunch by the beach was super worth it  I only spent 800 pesos! just took a trike to get there,5,November 2018
Truly a memorable experience! I already have my very own tree planted in the resort and it was named after me! Who can beat that? I highly appreciate the efforts of the team for this unique birthday surprise. They even research my favorites like playing the songs of my favorite singer - Shania Twain. I am just so happy! Thumbs up to the entire team! I will surely go back.,4,November 2018
We had the most pleasant stay in Crimson Boracay. The staff was friendly and accommodating making us feel like VIPS. Crimson took care of us from the moment we arrived from the airport. Our seaview suite was also to die for. I will most definitely stay here again,5,November 2018
"The beach in the resort is really clean and beautiful. You can use kayak and paddle boat, and restaurants are also good at cooking. All employees are very kind and convenient because shuttle runs often to Dmall. Both the swimming pools in the resort are very beautiful and pleasant. It is also close to the quiet Puka Beach.  If I go to Boracay again, I will choose the Crimson resort.",5,November 2018
"Foam pool party. Beautiful luxury rooms and 5 star service. From transportation to check out. Very seamless. Great free activities on the beach. Private car shuttles throughout the day. Did I mention, they have the best views and best sunsets.",5,November 2018
"A stunning international development in Station Zero away from the crowd and with the exclusivity of a private beach.   Rooms are Resort Chic and the highlight is the service; kind-hearted and genuine. A special shout-out to GM Laurent who made us feel so welcome and our stay so special. Food also is excellent with chefs from 7 countries.  Points to note; it has the biggest ballroom and only wedding chapel in hotel on the island. However, the are only soft-opened and there is still visible construction.",5,November 2018
"Unforgettable experience! Luxury facilities,specially their private beach! Fantastic! All Staff with outstanding performance, always deliver excellent service ahead from our request, very polite and friendly. Many thanks for all the team members from FO, F&B, Spa, Pool ,HSKP and Security. We will difenetely come back to this paradise resorts again. Highly recommend!! Joao&Timi",5,April 2018
"We booked Crimson for about 30 people from my company for a weekend business/vacation trip. Our experience was absolutely wonderful, and I cannot thank the Crimson staff enough for being so stellar. The rooms were all modern, comfortable, and full of nice little details (e.g. beach/pool robes). We also found the rates much more affordable compared to comparable resorts on Boracay. We really enjoyed the food. I at at both Saffron Cafe and the Azure Restaurant. Both had such a wide variety of delicious options that we all couldn't help but overstuff our plates. I especially liked the outdoor seating views with each meal. We also planned a private evening dinner on the beach one night. The food that night so authentic and phenomenal. The set up was magical on the beach, and Crimson‚Ä¶",5,April 2018
"Brand new hotel, still on soft opening, full of contemporary features, from the art displayed in the public areas to the unusal room decor. Superb secluded beach in a very quiet part of the island with a fantastic swimming pool and bar area adjacent to the beach. The staff are exceptional and nothing is too much trouble. However the standout feature of the hotel is the excellent food, not cheap, but always to an extremley high standard. A special mention must go to chef Raj who cooks the best indian food on the island and compares with the finest indian restaurants found in England. It is likley that as the hotel fully opens it will probably overtake the other 5 star resorts here in Boracay.",4,March 2018
"Great beach-front view and infinity pool, Delicious food.. great buffet selection for breakfast. But I think what sets Crimson Boracay apart from all the other resorts is the warm hospitality shown by all their staff. Everyone has a smile plastered on their face. They're very accomodating.. Excellent service.. to think I only went here during their soft-opening. Beats all other resorts nearby. :) ",5,February 2018
"Let me start by saying that my girlfriend and I flew over 8 hours to get to Boracay & had planned and booked this trip 4 months in advance. Both of us had never ever visited the island and were excited to see if we made the right choice in booking. I can tell you that after travelling to over 28 countries in my life, I have NEVER received such amazing treatment like I did here at this hotel.  We were pleasantly upgraded to a sea front suite upon arrival, and we got so many goodies in the room! The hotel itself is immaculate, modern & the rooms are SUPER amazing! We've stayed in many 5 star resorts and this by far surpassed our expectations! The food is out of this world....we had a romantic candle-lit dinner on the beach surrounded by candles & it was probably the best meal we‚Ä¶",5,April 2018
"I really enjoyed the stay at Crimson mostly because of the great service (friendly staff, tasty food clean and cozy rooms, etc) and wonderful almost private beach. I definitely recommend it both for business (good conference room and service) and vacations. Only wifi was weak and there was some loud rooster around the hotel but otherwise it was amazing.

"Due to traffic at d'mall, i was about to miss my scheduled bus. but with the driver's fast response, i was able to take on the bus 1 minute before departure. i really appreciate your service. :) and i had pleasure experience while staying in crimson, wanna visit again !  ",5,April 2018
Upon entering at the main gate the staffs are very welcoming. You can really feel the Filipino Hospitality. Smiles are everywhere. We tried the desserts at the Azure and their Milkshakes. It was superb. Thank you Crimson for the wonderful experience.,5,April 2018
"This hotel far exceeded our expectations! The staff throughout the hotel were incredibly attentive and friendly during our stay. The two infinity swimming pools were perfect to watch the sunset over the beautiful private beach. Boracay is known for its amazing white beaches, so it was a delight to find this hotel had a peaceful stretch that we could enjoy rather than being down in the town with the hustle and bustle of the throng of tourists. The hotel provide a shuttle service down to the town which we used. The buffet breakfast was superb and the standard of room was fabulous, of course this is a new hotel so all fixtures and fittings were brand new but they were good quality and the rooms were well laid out. Just make sure you remember to lower both blinds when in the rooms!‚Ä¶",5,March 2018
"We are currently staying at Shangri-la boracay and while scrolling in the internet, i saw a picture of crimson resort & spa, we got curious because the place looks wonderful too and we really want to try the dishes that their restaurant offers.We passed by through the road going down to the resort, very polite staff they assisted us going to the buffet restaurant, there this girl Stale, warm welcomed us and introduced the buffet.She assist us until we finish our meal and had a little talk made sure to provide everything we need...The food is very nice! Crossant is my fave! Me and my partner will surely comeback and will try the rooms as well... thumbs up to the service, food and view in the veranda! Thank you for a short but worth it experience!",5,April 2018
"We spent a week in this hotel and had the most amazing vacation. After being in Manila for a month for work, coming to this little slice of heaven was exactly what we needed. I need to call out Arnel, the activity guru for setting us up on a great island hopping trip and snorkel gear for the week. He was a true stand out for the week. Grace, in the restaurant, was also a sunny smiling face that we looked forward to seeing every morning. Both of them went way above and beyond to make our stay memorable. The hotel rooms are very modern. The multiple pools were perfect in every way! The staff was accommodating and amazingly helpful. There is a bit of construction going on at one end of the property, but we had no issues at all with noise or dust. They really have the perfect beach‚Ä¶",5,March 2018
"Stayed during an orthodontic conference( as this was an official hotel, suggested by the organizers). The rooms and location are very nice, but as the hotel was not fully operational(construction still going on, with associated noise/ something which was not disclosed during the booking process and staff not being fully trained) there were serious issues.  Firstly there was noise from construction work still taking place next to my room and from staff speaking loudly in the corridor and at reception as my room was very close to reception. This was rectified by the duty manager by transferring me to a quite suite, but only after the first two days which a had to spend in a noisy room (not the best way to start a supposedly relaxing vacation). To make matters worse, I realized‚Ä¶",3,March 2018
"I must say Cheers to a beautiful life in here.   Of all places I've been and faces I met, only in Crimson Boracay I felt the real luxurious life in terms of great services and of course its grandiose place.  Highly recommended for all types of visit.   I commend Jason Lagma  and Chris (crew) for the excellent services at the Beach Club, to Stale at Saffron Cafe, to Dennis Lumabao the rooms manager, to the front desk ladies Kristine, Louise, Dominic and Ni√±a Arabia, these guys are great, excellent in handling guests. Hats off.   Unparalleled services and beauty of living is indeed can be found here.   Amazing Cheers!  Lance   ",5,March 2018
This resort and spa is amazing! I love the light blue theme of this resort.  Their sunset also offers great choices of cocktails!  A must visit in Boracay if you wanna relax after a whole day of water activity. ,5,March 2018

"If you want vip service, quiet and contemporary modern resort. Look no further! Crimson at station zero is your new haven in boracay. Top notch service from the new caticlan airport meetup, to the van service, and speedboat transfer, to the unique resort GM welcome. All needs were accurately attended to, greetings by first name basis by staff. Small gestures like sending (anniversary cake & wine, different towel design on beds, apology cakes and personalized letters) made our stay even more memorable. Crimson team made it all possible. Looking forward to staying here again soon! Thank you!  Note: This is not a bias review. We paid for our stay :)",5,March 2018
"Crimson Resort is one of the newer resorts in the less crowded area of Boracay, Station Zero. The hotel is not quite completely finished, with some room options not available yet - such as the pool front properties. Also, one of the three resort restaurants is not open yet. That said, the soft opening aspect does not take away from the fact that this place is amazing and will be a very popular place to escape to in Boracay.  The rooms are amazing. We stayed in a suite, which has a separate living area from the bedroom. For some reason, this aspect is not displayed on their website or other travel booking sites. They should change their website to reflect the amazing features of their rooms. Our room was very spacious, beyond clean, and felt very luxurious.   The pool is an‚Ä¶",5,March 2018

"Going In , i dont have much to expect, as i always say, I am biased over Coron,Palawan, i would always find my self saying, ""would rather spend my money to go back  to Coron.""  A first timer in Boracay! Many are surprised as i have been travelling alot and Boracay was never in my must visit. As the place paint a different picture for me.  And then came Crimson Resort! Now I am transformed, already making plans  to come  back ,to bring my family.  It was such a relaxing, comforting, & welcoming atmosphere.   It is like you are on your own private resort.  Love the Staff, Love the room, you just dont want to leave...  Must try to really experience the difference...",5,March 2018
"The Crimson Hotel & Spa sets a new 5-Star standard of luxury in Boracay.  This hotel is everything you would expect from a 5-Star hotel and more. Recently completed, we came for a 9 night stay during their opening. The suites were large, bright and well appointed with panoramic views. The design and furnishing was exquisite.  The private beach has crystal clear water where you can swim, kayak or snorkel to see the giant clams. There are multiple fantastic hotel lifeguards patrolling the pools and beach and lending assistance when needed.  The food and beverage was exceptional and the staff to match. They knew your favourite foods and cocktails and even made healthy infant & children‚Äôs meals. The sunset cocktails while listening to the resident DJ certainly was a daily highlight.‚Ä¶",5,March 2018

Crimson was beautiful, quiet, and felt like how Boracay was 15 years ago.. just paradise.  Had a lovely stay. All the staff were extremely attentive and genuine!",5,February 2018

"We staying as part of a post-wedding celebration and couldn't have been more impressed by the amazing service and facilities we enjoyed at Crimson. The staff were extremely helpful and courteous, the rooms were just beautiful and the (almost private) beach setting is stunning!

So friendly, fun and knowledgable about local and global premium spirits - we had a great time hanging out at his bar.",5,February 2018
"Apart from the beautiful landscape and architectural design of this luxury resort, it is the service that stands out! They welcomed us with genuine smiles and catered all our needs excellently. What a privilege to be experiencing Station Zero. Room, food, service, and amenities are all outstanding! Take note that CRSB is still on soft opening... Can't wait for the grand launch!",5,February 2018

"One of the highlights of our trip to Boaracay was a surprise five star dinner at Crimson Resort by Filinvest. The parade of dishes served to us complemented the upscale interior and the romantic view of the sky and the sea. I particularly liked the wagyu beef, the seabass and the lobster.  For one on soft opening, the service was already truly impressive. I'm sure the opening in August will be a hit and will make waves as one of the places to go to when you visit Boracay. ",5,February 2018
"The Crimson is fresh off the runway and starting to get into its stride as a world-class resort in the idyllic Boracay. The aspect can‚Äôt be beat, the resort rolls down the hill and into a secluded beach-cove, with the whitest sand and clearest, warmest water I have ever seen.  Getting there was easy from Caticlan airport - the hotel collected me from the airport and arranged a short water taxi to the resort. Arriving on the beach was a spectacular scene.  The staff could not be more attentive or friendly. The food was delicious. The rooms are modern and well supplied. I can't wait to return!",5,October 2017
